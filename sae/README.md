# Nomic Embed SAE testing

This folder contains a notebook and script to play with an [SAE trained by Ian Johnson on nomic Embed](https://enjalot.github.io/latent-taxonomy/articles/about)!

The notebook `test_sae.ipynb` loads the SAE and `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` and allows you to write a list of test strings and see which features activate from the SAE

The script `mini_atlas_with_sae.py` lets you explore an Atlas dataset & see which features activate from the SAE as you change your data selection.
