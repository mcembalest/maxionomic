Cook, however, did not contribute much, playing in only 25 games and averaging 2.5 points per game.[1] The Celtics started the season 4-0 (with their first two games entering overtime, as well having another overtime game during their sixth game of the season), but Wicks and Rowe had trouble fitting in with Celtic coach Tom Heinsohn's system, and the team played .500 ball for most of the season.

Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move the franchise to California; however, the NBA would not allow him to take the cornerstone franchise out of Boston. NBA lawyer and future commissioner David Stern offered a compromise in which Levin and Brown would swap franchises, so that Levin could take over the Braves and move them to San Diego. Eventually, the owners of the 22 franchises voted 21–1 to approve the deal, and the Braves moved from Buffalo to San Diego (where they were renamed the Clippers). The deal also included a seven-player trade in which the Celtics acquired Nate Archibald, Billy Knight and Marvin Barnes in exchange for  Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, Kermit Washington and Sidney Wicks. The Braves would not request a draft pick in the deal, allowing the Celtics to retain the draft rights to future Hall of Famer Larry Bird. Coincidentally, the Braves played their last game of the season in Boston. It was one of only three seasons from 1951 to 1993 that the Celtics finished with a losing record.

Brown, Jr.  Levin had wanted to have a team in his native California, but knew the other league owners would not consider a move of the Celtics.  He therefore brokered a deal with Brown to swap franchises, and then moved the Braves to San Diego to become the Clippers.  In the meantime, a deal was brokered, without consulting team president Red Auerbach, to trade three players (Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert and Kermit Washington) to the Braves for Tiny Archibald, Billy Knight and Marvin Barnes.  The move created a media firestorm for the team, as Kunnert and Washington were viewed as keys to future improvement, and Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the move.  Brown would then trade three first-round draft picks for former Brave Bob McAdoo.[1]  Auerbach again was not consulted, and he almost took a job with the rival New York Knicks because of it.  By the start of the season, between trades and the retirement of team captain John Havlicek, only six players remained from the 1977–78 team, including the starting front three of Dave Cowens, Cedric Maxwell and Curtis Rowe, shooting guard Jo Jo White and backup point guards Don Chaney and Kevin Stacom.  Team depth issues were worsened when first round draft pick Larry Bird decided to remain in college for the season. Following the season, Brown would sell his portion of the team to partner Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. Brown would subsequently be elected Governor of his native Kentucky later that year.

Charlotte Hornets,1998,1999,"The 1998–99 NBA season was the eleventh season for the Charlotte Hornets in the National Basketball Association.[1] On March 23, 1998, the owners of all 29 NBA teams voted 27–2 to reopen the league's collective bargaining agreement, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system, and a ceiling on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed to the owners' plan, and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After both sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners called for a lockout, which began on July 1, 1998, putting a hold on all team trades, free agent signings and training camp workouts, and cancelling many NBA regular season and preseason games.[2][3][4][5][6] Due to the lockout, the NBA All-Star Game, which was scheduled to be played in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 14, 1999, was also cancelled.[7][8][9][10][11] However, on January 6, 1999, NBA commissioner David Stern, and NBPA director Billy Hunter finally reached an agreement to end the lockout. The deal was approved by both the players and owners, and was signed on January 20, ending the lockout after 204 days. The regular season began on February 5, and was cut short to just 50 games instead of the regular 82-game schedule.[12][13][14][15][16] During the off-season, the Hornets signed free agents Derrick Coleman,[17][18][19][20] three-point specialist Chuck Person,[21] Eldridge Recasner and Chucky Brown.[22] However, the Hornets began their season dealing with injuries, as Anthony Mason was lost for the entire season with a biceps injury suffered in practice a few days before the start of the season,[23][24][25] and All-Star forward Glen Rice was also out with an elbow injury.[26][27][28] The Hornets struggled losing eight of their first nine games, which led to a disappointing 4–11 start to the season, as head coach Dave Cowens resigned and was replaced with assistant Paul Silas.[29][30][31] A few days later, Rice was traded along with J.R. Reid, and B. J. Armstrong to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for All-Star guard Eddie Jones, and Elden Campbell.[32][33][34][35] Armstrong was released by the Lakers, and later signed with the Orlando Magic.[36][37][38] The team improved under Silas posting a 22–13 record, including a nine-game winning streak in April. The Hornets finished fifth in the Central Division with a 26–24 record.[39] However, despite their above .500 record, they failed to qualify for the playoffs by a single game.  This was the first time since the 1995–96 season the Hornets missed the playoffs. Jones averaged 17.0 points and 3.0 steals per game with the team in 30 games after the trade, and was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, while Campbell averaged 15.3 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game in 32 games.

The Bulls got off to a fast start winning their first twelve games of the season,[14][15] while posting a 42–6 record before the All-Star break.[16] In April, the team signed free agent Brian Williams, who previously played for the Los Angeles Clippers last season, and spent most of the 1996–97 season as a free agent; Williams played in the final nine games of the regular season as a backup center for the Bulls.[17][18][19][20] Though, the Bulls look to make history against the New York Knicks in their final regular season game of the year, Pippen missed a game-winning three-pointer and they finished with a 69–13 record, just missing out on becoming the first team in NBA history to have back-to-back 70 wins seasons.[21][22][23][24][25] The Bulls had the fourth best team defensive rating in the NBA.[26] Jordan led the league in scoring once again, averaging 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.7 steals per game, while being named to the All-NBA First Team, while Pippen averaged 20.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 1.9 steals per game, and was selected to the All-NBA Second Team. Both Jordan and Pippen were named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. In addition, Rodman led the league with 16.1 rebounds per game,[27] but only played 55 games due to suspensions and injuries, such as serving an 11-game suspension for kicking a cameraman during a road game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 15, 1997,[28][29][30][31][32] and a knee injury which cost him to miss the final 13 games of the regular season.[33][34][35][36] Kukoč provided scoring off the bench, averaging 13.2 points per game, but only played 57 games due to a foot injury,[37][38][39] while Luc Longley provided the team with 9.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, Kerr contributed 8.1 points per game off the bench, while shooting .464 in three-point field goal percentage, second-year forward Jason Caffey averaged 7.3 points and 4.0 rebounds per game, starting at power forward in a few games during Rodman's suspension, and Ron Harper contributed 6.3 points and 2.5 assists per game.[27] Jordan also finished in second place in Most Valuable Player voting.[40][41] Meanwhile, Pippen finished in fourth place in Defensive Player of the Year voting, while Jordan finished in fifth place,[42] and Kukoč finished in second place in Sixth Man of the Year voting.[43][44][45][46] Kerr also won the Three-Point Shootout during the All-Star Weekend in Cleveland, Ohio.[47][48][49] In the playoffs, the Bulls would sweep the Washington Bullets in three straight games in the Eastern Conference First Round.[50][51][52][53] In the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, they defeated the Atlanta Hawks in five games,[54][55][56][57] despite losing Game 2 at the United Center, 103–95.[58][59][60] In the Eastern Conference Finals, they defeated the Miami Heat in five games to advance to the NBA Finals,[61][62][63][64] where they defeated regular season MVP Karl Malone, John Stockton and the Utah Jazz in six games for their fifth title in seven years.[65][66][67][68][69] Following the season, Parish retired after 21 seasons in the NBA,[70][71][72] while Williams signed as a free agent with the Detroit Pistons,[73][74][75][76] and Dickey Simpkins was traded to the Golden State Warriors.[77][78]",Phil Jackson,0.841,1.0,True,True,True,True,1.0

During the off-season, the Bulls acquired Scott Burrell from the Golden State Warriors,[2][3][4] and signed free agent Joe Kleine.[5] However, All-Star forward Scottie Pippen would miss the first half of the season due to an injured toe on his left foot sustained from the 1997 NBA Playoffs.[6][7][8][9] Without Pippen, the Bulls started with a slow 9–7 record in November, but then would go on a 15–4 record until he returned in January. However, three-point specialist Steve Kerr went down with a fractured collarbone in January, and played just 50 games.[10][11][12] Despite the injuries, the Bulls held a 34–15 record at the All-Star break.[13] At mid-season, the team traded Jason Caffey to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for David Vaughn.[14][15][16] Vaughn would only play just three games with the Bulls before being waived on March 2, 1998. Also in early March, the team re-signed former Bulls reserve forward Dickey Simpkins, who was previously released by the Warriors, and played in the final 21 games of the regular season.[17] The Bulls would post a 13-game winning streak between March and April, and still finish first place in the Central Division and Eastern Conference with a 62–20 record.[18] The Bulls had the third best team defensive rating in the NBA.[19] In the playoffs, the Bulls swept the New Jersey Nets, 3–0 in the Eastern Conference First Round,[20][21][22][23] defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 4–1 in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals,[24][25][26][27] despite losing Game 2 at the United Center, 78–76,[28][29][30] and then defeated the Indiana Pacers, 4–3 in the Eastern Conference Finals en route to advance to the NBA Finals.[31][32][33][34] In the Finals, they met the Utah Jazz in a rematch from the prior year's NBA Finals and just like last year, they would go on to defeat the Jazz in six games to win the championship.

Chicago Bulls,1998,1999,"The 1998–99 Chicago Bulls season was the franchise's 33rd season in the National Basketball Association.[1] On March 23, 1998, the owners of all 29 NBA teams voted 27–2 to reopen the league's collective bargaining agreement, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system, and a ceiling on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed to the owners' plan, and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After both sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners called for a lockout, which began on July 1, 1998, putting a hold on all team trades, free agent signings and training camp workouts, and cancelling many NBA regular season and preseason games.[2][3][4][5][6] Due to the lockout, the NBA All-Star Game, which was scheduled to be played in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 14, 1999, was also cancelled.[7][8][9][10][11] However, on January 6, 1999, NBA commissioner David Stern, and NBPA director Billy Hunter finally reached an agreement to end the lockout. The deal was approved by both the players and owners, and was signed on January 20, ending the lockout after 204 days. The regular season began on February 5, and was cut short to just 50 games instead of the regular 82-game schedule.[12][13][14][15][16] The Bulls entered the season as the three-time defending NBA champions, having defeated the Utah Jazz in the 1998 NBA Finals in six games, winning their sixth NBA championship, and completing a second three-peat in the 1990s. However, with Phil Jackson's resignation as head coach, the departures of Scottie Pippen (who was traded to the Houston Rockets), Dennis Rodman (who signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent), and Michael Jordan announcing his retirement for the second time on January 13, 1999, during the latter stages of the lockout, it marked the end of the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s.[17] Under new head coach Tim Floyd,[18][19][20] plus the off-season acquisitions of Brent Barry,[21][22][23] Mark Bryant, and Andrew Lang,[24][25][26] the Bulls were a shell of their former selves, losing eight of their first nine games of the season. The team lost 14 of their final 17 games, and finished in last place in the Central Division with a 13–37 record (roughly the equivalent of 21–61),[27] missing the playoffs for the first time since 1984.[28] Toni Kukoč led the team with 18.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, while Ron Harper averaged 11.2 points and 1.7 steals per game, and Barry contributed 11.1 points per game. In addition, Dickey Simpkins showed improvement averaging 9.1 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, while Bryant provided the team with 9.0 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, and Randy Brown contributed 8.8 points and 1.7 steals per game.[29] The Bulls were just the second defending champions to miss the postseason, behind the 1969–70 Boston Celtics. On April 10, 1999, the Bulls set an all-time NBA record low for points in the shot clock era in an 82–49 loss at the United Center to the Miami Heat.[30][31][32][33] Following the season, Barry was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics,[34][35][36] while Harper signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers to reunite with Jackson, who was hired to coach the Lakers,[37][38][39] Bryant signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Lang and Bill Wennington were both released to free agency.[40]",Tim Floyd,0.26,8.0,False,False,False,False,15.0

Head coach Tim Floyd resigned on Christmas Eve after a 4–21 start to the season, then after two games under assistant Bill Berry, the team hired former Bulls center Bill Cartwright as their new coach.

(See 2001–02 Chicago Bulls season#Regular season) In 2001-02, the make-up and direction of the Chicago Bulls changed significantly: by the season's end, a pair of 18-year-old phenoms and an All-Star caliber player were in the line-up while Elton Brand, once thought to be the franchise's cornerstone for rebuilding efforts, was not. The result was a renewed sense of optimism and hope surrounding the team's future with Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Jalen Rose as the centers of attention. It all began on the night of the 2001 NBA draft, when the Bulls used their first-round pick, fourth overall, to select Thornwood High School's Eddy Curry, a 6–11, 285-pound center. Minutes later, Chicago dealt Brand to the L.A. Clippers for Dominguez High School product Tyson Chandler (picked second overall) and Brian Skinner. Chicago also acquired one of the steals of the draft in Trenton Hassell out of Austin Peay in the second round.

On Feb. 18, the Bulls grabbed a franchise-low 25 rebounds in Miami. A change was needed and on February 19, it was delivered in the form of a seven-player trade. The Bulls acquired Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman Richardson from the Indiana Pacers for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie. “We feel Jalen is an outstanding all-around player who can play three positions offensively and defensively,” EVP of Basketball Operations Jerry Krause explained. “He’s a very good passer, extremely unselfish, a fine scorer and in the prime of his career at age 29. His leadership qualities and versatility are an added plus.” “I'm excited about it,” Rose said upon his arrival to Chicago. “I embrace the opportunity. Every kid dreams about standing in this position talking about having an opportunity to take a team to a championship level.” The team went on to post their first three-game winning streak in two years from Feb. 20–23. Jamal Crawford, who tore his ACL over the summer and required surgery to repair it, returned to the active roster on March 3 after missing the first 58 games of the season.

With the regular season over, the Bulls would be seeded #3 in the Eastern Conference behind the Atlanta Hawks (#1) and the Cleveland Cavaliers (#2).[215] The Bulls would have home-court advantage in the First Round when playing the sixth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks and would lose it when the Cavaliers (Chicago's Conference semifinals opponent) defeated the seventh-seeded Boston Celtics.[215][216] In the First Round, the Bulls would meet its Central Division opponent in the Milwaukee Bucks for the first time since the First Round of the 1990 NBA Playoffs.[217] After injuring his anterior cruciate ligament in the 2012 playoff opener against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose returned to play in his first playoff game since the injury to play the Bucks.[218] In the game, he would accumulate 23 points and seven assists.[218] The second game of the series would get physical as seven technical fouls were called and Bucks player Zaza Pachulia would be ejected.[219] Despite a poor outing from Rose, Butler would go off and score 31 points for the victory.[219] In what would be a crucial Game 3 for the Bucks, the Bulls would hold Milwaukee off in double overtime, which was spearheaded by Rose's 34 points.[220] After scoring playoff career-highs in Games 1 and 2, Butler would have another career-high of 33 points but the Bulls would lose Game 4 with a season-high 26 turnovers.[221] In the closing seconds of the game, Rose would turn over the ball and, after a timeout for the Bucks, Jerryd Bayless would get away from Rose to execute a buzzer-beating layup, causing Chicago to lose 90–92.[221] They then dropped game 5 at home, cutting their lead to 3–2. But despite struggling in the previous two games, the Bulls would finish the series by pummeling the Bucks with a franchise record 54-point blowout victory on the road, surpassing the previous record of 42 that was set in Game 3 of the 1998 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz.[222] Just before Game 6, it was announced that Nikola Mirotić came in second place in voting for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award for 2014–15.[223] After defeating the Milwaukee Bucks, the Bulls would face another divisional rival, the Cleveland Cavaliers, in what was regarded as a marquee match-up.[224] The last time the two teams had played each other was back in the First round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs when the then-first seed Cavaliers would defeat the then-eighth seed Bulls four games to one.[225] For the Cavaliers, they would be playing with Kevin Love out for the rest of the season and J. R. Smith out for Games 1 and 2.[226] However, at this time for the Bulls, it was reported that there had been a long-standing feud between Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau and the organization's management.[227] Despite the dysfunction in the Bulls organization, the team itself would take Game 1 in a 99–92 victory after Rose who scored 23 points had an injury scare.[228] On May 6, it was reported that Jimmy Butler won the NBA Most Improved Player Award thus becoming the first Bull in franchise history to win it.[229] In Game 2, Chicago would be blown out by Cleveland and was dealt its first loss of the series.[230] At halftime, Joakim Noah would shove a fan which led to a $25,000 fine.[231] After splitting the first two games, the series would continue at the United Center for Game 3. Up until the third game, there were no lead changes because the Bulls always led in Game 1 and the Cavaliers always led in Game 2.[232] In an evenly matched game, the Bulls and Cavaliers both played with grit but the Bulls would pull through after 2011 Most Valuable Player Derrick Rose shot a game-winning three-point buzzer beater to win the game 99–96.[233] Aside from the fact that the shot was his second career buzzer beater, it was the first playoff buzzer beater for the team since Michael Jordan's buzzer beater in Game 1 of the 1997 NBA Finals and the team's last game-winning shot in the last ten seconds since Jordan's memorable championship-winning shot with 5.2 seconds remaining in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals.[234] During the game, Pau Gasol would be taken out because of a hamstring injury.[235] On May 9, talk of the possibility of having two champions in the same city and season began.[236] The Chicago Blackhawks were en route to the Conference Final of the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs and the Bulls were up 2–1 in the conference semifinals against the Cavaliers.[236] The next day, Butler, whose contract would expire at the end of the season, would state that he planned to remain with the Bulls.[237] This was after rejecting a four-year, $42 million contract back in October 2014.[237] In Game 4, with the game tied 84 apiece, LeBron James would return the favor with a two-point buzzer beater, causing the Bulls to lose 84–86.[238] Source: NBA.com Source: RealGM.com Source: Basketball-Reference (through Wayback Machine) After the Iowa Energy entered a single-affiliation partnership with the Memphis Grizzlies on May 6, 2014,[239] the Bulls would be affiliated with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants starting in the 2014–15 NBA Development League season.[240]",Tom Thibodeau,0.61,2.0,True,False,False,False,3.0

The 1960-61 Detroit Pistons were an offensive minded team, finishing their season at 2nd overall in Offensive Rating in the 1960-61 NBA season, which included eight NBA teams. However, Detroit had one of the poorer defenses in the NBA, ranking 6th overall in Defensive Rating.[1] Detroit ranked 6th overall in field goal attempts and 4th overall in field goal percentage and Effective Field Goal Percentage.

However, Detroit still ended the year with the same amount of losses as the 1959-60 season. This is because the NBA expanded their schedule from 75 to 79 games in the 1960-61 season, so the Pistons played four more games than the 1959-1960 season.[1] Although the Pistons had a 34-45 (.430) losing record, they still made it to the 1961 NBA playoffs where they played the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers hosted the first two games of the series, beating the Pistons 120–102 on March 14, 1961, and 127–118 on March 15th. The Pistons were able to tie the series after beating the Lakers twice in Detroit with scores of 124–113 on March 17 and 123–114 on March 18.[3] The March 17th victory was bolstered by a defensive assignment switch which placed Walter Dukes on Laker's star, Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who had averaged 44.5 points in the first two games in Los Angeles, was held to 26 points with only 10 of those points coming in the second half.[4] The Pistons lost to the Lakers in the final game of the series 137–120, and were eliminated from the playoffs.[3]",Dick McGuire,0.43,3.0,True,False,False,False,

The team had a winning record for the first time since 2008. This season included the first playoff series victory for the first time since 2007, as most of the squad experienced postseason play for the first time. The season began a streak of 7 straight winning records. The Warriors had four draft picks in the 2012 NBA draft, a decisive draft year that was vital for a potential future for the team. The picks included Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. With Brandon Rush and his season-ending injury, Barnes was placed in the starting lineup and became crucial in bringing the team back to the playoffs for the first time in six years. Another injury mid-season from Andrew Bogut also affected the team with the lack of a true center for a majority of the season. The season was marked by significant highlights, such as Stephen Curry surpassing the existing record for the most three-point field goals made in a single season, where Curry's achievement of 272 three-pointers broke the previous record held by Ray Allen for seven years, which stood at 269.

On May 14, 2014, the Warriors hired Steve Kerr to a five-year, $25 million deal to become the team's new head coach, succeeding Mark Jackson, who was fired eight days earlier.[1] It was the first head coaching job for Kerr, with a prior NBA background as a five-time NBA champion guard who set an all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr's extensive background experience also entailed his service as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team from 2007 to 2010 and operating as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). The team also signed point guard Shaun Livingston[2] and guard Leandro Barbosa[3] during the off-season. Under Kerr's first year at the helm, the Warriors won their first five games before going on a 16-game winning streak from November 13 to December 14, to shoot the record to a 21–2 start to the season, their best start in franchise history at the time.

With their win against the Portland Trail Blazers on March 24, they clinched the Pacific Division for the first time since the 1975–76 season, also tying the franchise record for road wins in a season with 24. On March 28, the Warriors won their 60th game and clinched the best record in the Western Conference and set a franchise record for regular season wins, surpassing the previous win of 59 games set by them during the 1975–76 season. In what would ultimately turn out to be the Warrior's breakout season, the team finished the 2014–15 regular season garnering a league-best record of 67–15.[4] They became the tenth NBA team to win 67 games in a season and finished with a home record of 39–2, the second-best in NBA history, alongside a road record of 28–13. The Warriors also ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both categories. On May 4, 2015, Stephen Curry was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 to be bestowed with the honor. In the playoffs, the Warriors swept the Anthony Davis-led New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, dismantled the Marc Gasol-led Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched the James Harden-led Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The team advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, finding themselves pitted up against the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. In the ensuing years of the Warriors' successive reign in establishing themselves as the NBA's most dominant force, the Cavaliers emerged as their perennial opponents in each of the subsequent three successive NBA Finals, sparking a fiercely contested league rivalry that developed and lasted between the two teams over the next 3 Finals series matchups. After Golden State fell behind 2–1 in the series, head coach Steve Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[5] The Warriors won the last three games and the series in six, winning their first NBA championship title in 40 years and their fourth in franchise history.[6][7]  Iguodala was named Finals MVP, becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award without starting a single regular season game.[8] The team registered a grand total of 83 victories throughout the season, a commendable achievement that ranks as the third highest in NBA history where they went an aggregate total of 83–20 encompassing both regular season and playoff matches. Moreover, Kerr became the first rookie head coach to win an NBA title since Pat Riley during the 1981–82 season.[9] Numerous Warriors players set individual records over the course of the season. Stephen Curry won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, the first Warriors player to win since Wilt Chamberlain in the 1959–60 NBA season, when the franchise was still located in Philadelphia. He also broke his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 272, finishing with 286. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke the NBA record for most points scored in a quarter with 37, finishing the game with a career high 52 points. Head Coach Steve Kerr's 67 wins with the Warriors set the NBA record for most wins by a rookie head coach. Curry and Thompson, dubbed the ""Splash Brothers"", broke the single-season record for most three-pointers made by a pair of teammates. Both also made the All-Star team, Curry as a starter and Thompson as a reserve.

McDaniels grabbed Thompson, who eventually had his jersey ripped. In the ensuing scuffle, Draymond Green placed Rudy Gobert in a headlock. This resulted in Green, Thompson, and McDaniels all being ejected from the game. Green was suspended for five games and, along with Thompson, Gobert, and McDaniels, was fined for the incident.

However, with increased competition in the West, management felt a change was needed to win another title. On February 14, 1995, the Rockets traded Otis Thorpe to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for All-Star guard Clyde Drexler, and three-point specialist Tracy Murray; Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon were both teammates at the University of Houston in the early 1980s.[2][3][4][5][6] The team also signed free agent Chucky Brown midway through the season,[7][8] and later on signed 38-year old veteran Charles Jones to a 10-day contract in April, where he played in the final three games of the regular season.[9][10] However, after holding a 29–17 record at the All-Star break,[11] the Rockets played .500 basketball in the second half of the season, posting an 18–18 record on their way to finishing third in the Midwest Division with a 47–35 record.[12] Olajuwon averaged 27.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 3.4 blocks per game, and was selected for the 1995 NBA All-Star Game,[13][14][15][16] while Drexler averaged 21.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.7 steals per game in 35 games with the Rockets after the trade.

In addition, Derek Fisher provided the team with 10.5 points and 3.6 assists per game, while Rick Fox contributed 9.0 points per game, and Robert Horry provided with 6.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game.[11] Kobe and Shaq were both named to the All-NBA First Team, and were both selected to play in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta.[12] Kobe was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team, and finished in third place in MVP voting with 8 first-place votes,[13][14] while Shaq was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, and finished in fifth place in MVP voting with 3 first-place votes.[15][14] Facing an uphill battle without home-court advantage, the Lakers managed to beat the 4th-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference First Round of the playoffs,[16][17][18] but fell to the top-seeded and eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in six games in the Western Conference Semi-finals.[19][20][21] The Spurs would reach the Finals to defeat the New Jersey Nets in six games, winning their second championship.[22][23][24] Following the season, Horry signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs,[25][26] while Mark Madsen signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves,[27] Samaki Walker signed with the Miami Heat,[28] and Brian Shaw retired. The season was overshadowed by the death of long-time Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn, who died after a fall in the summer of 2002.[29][30][31][32] To pay tribute, the Lakers donned an alternate white uniform, which can be only worn on Christmas and Sunday home games.[33] The uniforms made its debut in a home loss against the Sacramento Kings on Christmas Day. They were designed by late owner Jerry Buss' daughter, who is now the controlling owner and president of the Los Angeles Lakers, Jeanie.[citation needed]",Phil Jackson,0.61,2.0,True,False,False,False,5.0
Los Angeles Lakers,2003,2004,"The 2003–04 NBA season was the Lakers' 56th season in the National Basketball Association and 44th in the city of Los Angeles.[1] The Lakers entered the season following a disappointing second-round loss to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the 2003 playoffs. During the offseason, the Lakers signed star free agents Karl Malone and Gary Payton and re-signed free agent power forward Horace Grant.[2][3] Following these acquisitions, the Lakers became the instant favorites to win the NBA title.[4][5] Despite major acquisitions, key moves, and becoming overnight title favorites, the Lakers would run into major setbacks to begin the season. During the 2003 off-season, superstar guard Kobe Bryant had been accused of sexual assault in Colorado. Media attention surrounding the case would prove to be an ongoing distraction for the team, and Bryant missed games during his trial. In addition, Bryant's feud with Shaquille O'Neal reached a peak during the season, as both players criticized each other in the media.[6] Payton struggled with coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense, and Malone missed significant time due to injuries.[7][8][9] Despite the setbacks, the Lakers finished the season with a 56–26 overall record, good enough to clinch the second seed in the Western Conference en route to the playoffs.[10] In the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Rockets, the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, and the Minnesota Timberwolves to earn the franchise its 28th appearance in the NBA Finals. The Lakers entered the Finals against the Detroit Pistons as favorites.[11][12]
This was the third meeting between the Lakers and the Pistons in the NBA Finals, after both franchises met in 1988 and 1989.  However, the underdog Pistons' strong defense and teamwork propelled them to their third championship in franchise history, and the star-studded Lakers would collapse in five games.[13][14] After the season, Jackson and the team mutually agreed to part ways[15] and O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat.[16]",Phil Jackson,0.683,1.0,True,True,True,False,2.0
Los Angeles Lakers,2004,2005,"The 2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers season was the 57th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the 45th in the city of Los Angeles.[1] The previous season had ended with a crushing defeat in five games to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals, despite the Lakers being heavily favored. The 2004–05 season is best remembered as a tough one for the Lakers, winning only 34 games and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. It was also the Lakers first season since 1995-96 without either center Shaquille O'Neal, who was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, and future draft picks, or point guard Derek Fisher (who had signed a six-year free agent contract with the Golden State Warriors), two instrumental players to the Lakers' previous three championship victories. The Lakers had the worst team defensive rating in the NBA.[2] Phil Jackson was also fired in the offseason and replaced by former Houston Rockets head coach Rudy Tomjanovich. However, in February 2005, Tomjanovich's struggle with bladder cancer that had been diagnosed since 2003 forced him to resign after a 24–19 start and be replaced by Jackson's assistant coach Frank Hamblen for the rest of the year. In the offseason, Butler was traded to the Washington Wizards, Hamblen was fired as head coach and Vlade Divac retired. For the season, the Lakers slightly changed their uniforms, adding the secondary logo to their shorts. They remained in use until 2018. The Lakers would not miss the playoffs again until 2014. This was the first team since the 1998–99 Chicago Bulls and last until the 2014–15 Miami Heat to miss the playoffs after making a Finals appearance as well as the last until the 2014–15 Heat to miss the playoffs after losing the previous year's Finals.","Rudy Tomjanovich (resigned)

The Lakers finished in third place of the Pacific Division and as the seventh seed of the Western Conference. The season ended with the team being eliminated in seven games against the Phoenix Suns in the First Round of the playoffs after holding a 3–1 series lead. After a year absence, the Lakers rehired Phil Jackson as their head coach. It was the final season that Kobe Bryant wore jersey number 8 before changing it to 24 the following season. Also memorable from this season was during a January 22, 2006 game vs. the Toronto Raptors where Bryant dropped a record 81 points, only the 2nd highest total in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. After the playoffs, Bryant underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in July.

Los Angeles Lakers,2007,2008,"The 2007–08 Los Angeles Lakers season was the 60th season of the franchise, 59th in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and 48th in Los Angeles. During the offseason, the Lakers re-signed point guard Derek Fisher. The Lakers celebrated their 60th anniversary, thus the Laker jerseys wore the 60th anniversary patches on the leftmost part. They finished the regular season with 57 wins, finishing with the most wins in the tightest conference race in NBA history. The Lakers clinched the top seed in the playoffs for the 29th time in franchise history. This 15-game turnaround from the prior season has been attributed to the progress of the team's bench players and the  mid-season trade for Pau Gasol. The Lakers sold out all 41 home games for the season. After 12 seasons in the NBA, Kobe Bryant was named the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player for the first and only time in his career. The Lakers had the third best team offensive rating and the fifth best team defensive rating in the NBA.[1] In the playoffs, the Lakers swept the Denver Nuggets in four games in the First Round, defeated the Utah Jazz in six games in the Semifinals, and defeated the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in five games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals since 2004. In the NBA Finals, the Lakers faced off against their rivals, the Boston Celtics, renewing their storied rivalry, and marking the first time the two teams faced off against each other in the NBA Finals since 1987. However, the Lakers would lose against the Celtics in the NBA Finals in six games, ending with a blowout defeat to the Celtics in Game 6 by 39 points, losing 92–131, and marking the Lakers' ninth defeat to the Celtics in the NBA Finals. Following the 2006–07 NBA season, their offseason was marred with surgeries to their two key players. The first of which was Lamar Odom having shoulder surgery which made him miss the first five games of the 2007–08 NBA season. The other was Kwame Brown having shoulder surgery also. The Lakers' first signing was their first-round draft pick Javaris Crittenton. Then the Lakers re-signed Luke Walton to a six-year contract extension worth $30 million.[2] Chris Mihm also signed a new contract for two years despite missing the entire previous season after having surgery on his right ankle. Walton was a key player last season while Mihm was sidelined for the whole season. The most notable signing of the Lakers off-season was past hero Derek Fisher, signed to a three-year deal worth approximately $14 million.[3] Fisher was released from the Utah Jazz at his request during the offseason so his family could move to a city that has better treatment for his daughter, who was diagnosed with retinoblastoma. The Lakers signed him in order to add stability at the point and they needed a player who was well versed in the triangle offense. The Lakers were also hoping that signing a former veteran of the Lakers would ease Bryant's demand to be traded. Andrew Bynum and Jordan Farmar had their 4th-year and 3rd-year contracts extended respectively. This kept each player with the team for at least one more year. D. J. Mbenga and rookie Coby Karl were also signed with the team to fill roster spots. Coby Karl, the son of Nuggets coach George Karl, switched between the NBDL and Lakers roster throughout the season. During midseason, injuries plagued the team and Ira Newble was signed to a ten-day contract. After this he signed a contract for the rest of the season. The most notable departure was last year's starting point guard Smush Parker to the Miami Heat. Aaron McKie left the Lakers and became a voluntary coach for the 76ers. After spending one year with the Lakers, Shammond Williams left via free agency to play for Pamesa Valencia of the ACB. Early in the season the Lakers traded Maurice Evans and under-achieving power forward Brian Cook for forward Trevor Ariza. Ariza would average 6.5 points per game, averaging only 18 minutes per game.[4] Ariza broke his foot in practice on January 20 and missed the rest of the regular season. He returned to the Lakers on May 23.[5] After Andrew Bynum was injured for the rest of the season, the Lakers needed help in the front court before they risked falling out of contention in the playoff race. In February, the Lakers traded Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie (who was re-signed specifically for the trade), the draft rights to Marc Gasol, two first-round draft picks (2008 and 2010) and cash for Pau Gasol and a second-round draft pick in 2010. Many consider the Lakers the major benefactor of the trade.[6][7] As a result, some criticized the trade as being unbalanced in excessively benefiting the Lakers. Gregg Popovich called Memphis' agreement to the terms of the trade ""beyond comprehension"" and suggested that the league should form a committee to ""scratch all trades that make no sense"".[8] The trade became an immediate success for the Lakers, who went 22–5 with Gasol in the lineup and went on to reach the NBA Finals. Los Angeles had three selections for the 2007 NBA draft.[9] With their first-round pick, the Lakers selected Georgia Tech freshman point guard Javaris Crittenton. With their second pick coming from the Bobcats, the Lakers selected the 6-foot-9-inch (2.06 m) Chinese player Sun Yue. And with their final pick the Lakers selected Pau Gasol's younger brother, Marc. Marc Gasol and Crittenton were both traded midseason for Pau Gasol. Sun Yue spent the entire 2007–08 season playing in the ABA and China national basketball team and only played 10 games total in the NBA. Following the 2006–07 NBA season the future of Kobe Bryant's career as a Laker fell into doubt, when he demanded to be traded.[11] For a week he tiraded and the situation escalated when a videotape about him was released. The video recorded him saying that the Lakers should have traded Andrew Bynum for Jason Kidd. Bryant insulted Bynum and was critical of General Manager Mitch Kupchak. Management decided to re-sign Derek Fisher, a past hero, but the Lakers would enter the season frustrated and with question marks. [citation needed] The Lakers started the 2007–08 NBA season surprisingly well. Fueled by the emergence of Andrew Bynum as a main option at center and the return of Derek Fisher, the Lakers would even enjoy being the number one team in the Western Conference for three days. Capped by an early-season trade for Trevor Ariza, rumors of Bryant wanting to leave Los Angeles were finally beginning to die. However, before the Lakers could savor their new success, Bynum would go down with a knee injury that would take him out for the remainder of the season. Suddenly, the contending Lakers lost three straight games. The remainder of the season looked bleak for the Lakers, who were struggling to win games. It seemed that injuries, once again, would cripple another Laker season. On February 1, the Lakers dealt the unpopular Kwame Brown (who was booed viciously by the fans for his many turnovers in recent games [12]), rookie Javaris Crittenton, veteran Aaron McKie, the draft rights to his brother Marc Gasol, and first-round picks in 2008 and 2010 for Spaniard all-star forward Pau Gasol and a second-round draft choice in 2010.[13] With the Lakers now having a center and power forward who are both 7 feet (2.1 m) tall, analysts have referred to Gasol and Bynum as ""the twin towers"",[14] similar to the duo of Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Even while waiting for Bynum's return, the Lakers were playing very well and got a second taste of being best in the Western Conference. With Kobe Bryant leading the charge with his MVP-caliber season, the month of April was successful for the Lakers, who quickly surged to the top of Western Conference. Aided by Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom's play as second and third options respectively, the Lakers clinched their playoff berth for the 55th time in their 60 years with the league, won the Pacific Division from the Phoenix Suns (their first since Shaq left in 2004), and clinched the number one seed in the Western Conference for the first time since the 1999–2000 NBA season. Kobe Bryant publicly announced his desire to remain as a Laker.[15] During the second round against the Utah Jazz, Byrant was officially named the 2007–2008 NBA Most Valuable Player award, to which he promised the fans that the team would ""play until June"", that he was ""very proud to represent [the] organization, to represent [the] city"" and thanked his teammates for helping him win the MVP award for the first time in his 12-season career. He said, ""the special thing about this award is that we have done it together. I can't stress it enough. This is not an individual award.""[16] Furthermore, the team had bonded during training camp last October in Honolulu when Lamar Odom hired a chef to cook for the team. ""I won't take the credit"", Odom said, ""but in training camp we became tighter. I made sure we had a chef. We ate dinner, lunch and breakfast together every day at training camp. I think that was special. I think that's when the bond started."" Additionally, Byrant's behavior towards his teammates changed as well. ""It's the little things, taking guys out to dinner, talking to guys more about things"", Luke Walton said. ""He's such a great player, I think sometimes it gets frustrating if we don't understand something. But he's taking the time to explain what guys are doing out there a little more. I think before he used to be a little more negative towards his teammates, as opposed to now, when he's pulling people to the side, talking to them, finding out ways to figure it out together instead of just coming down hard on them. He's definitely more patient. He's having more fun. I think he's enjoying it more, especially with the team going like this.""[17] In Pau Gasol's playoff debut with the Lakers, he scored 36 points, with 16 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 blocked shots, as the Lakers beat the Nuggets in Game 1. After Game 1, Kobe Bryant publicly announced his desire to remain as a Laker.[18] Kobe Bryant gave the fans a vintage performance in Game 2 by scoring 49 points and adding 10 assists in a blowout at Staples Center. Game 2 against the Nuggets would mark a playoff first in which Lakers rookie guard Coby Karl became the first player to go against his coaching father, George Karl, in an NBA playoff game.[19] The Nuggets were routed at home in Game 3, with Carmelo Anthony stating the team quit in the second half. Game 4 was closer, but Bryant led the Lakers with 14 points in the last five and a half minutes to close out the Nuggets at the Pepsi Center. The Lakers were the only team in 2008 to sweep an opponent in the playoffs. The Lakers faced the Utah Jazz in the second round of the playoffs which began on May 4 at Staples Center. It was the first time the two franchises had competed in a post-season series since the 1998 Western Conference finals. Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher, and Utah Head Coach Jerry Sloan and Assistant Coach Phil Johnson, were the only individuals present from the 1998 series that were in this series. Conversely, it was also the first play-off series meeting between Coach Sloan and Lakers' Head Coach Phil Jackson since the Chicago Bulls defeated the Jazz in the NBA Finals that same year. The Lakers took game 1 at Staples Center, winning by 11 against the Jazz. During Game 2 against the Utah Jazz, Bryant was officially named the 2007–2008 NBA Most Valuable Player award, to which he promised the fans that the team would ""play until June"", that he was ""very proud to represent [the] organization, to represent [the] city"" and thanked his teammates for helping him win the MVP award for the first time in his 12-season career. He said, ""the special thing about this award is that we have done it together. I can't stress it enough. This is not an individual award.""[16] After being presented the trophy Bryant led his team to their second victory with 34 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists. Having a 6–0 record in the playoffs, the Lakers traveled to Utah to play the third and fourth games of the series. However their streak would come to a sudden halt. The Jazz won both Games 3 and 4 to even up the series with Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer, who bounced back after having two terrible games at L.A., leading the team. Game 4 went to overtime which the Lakers lost for the first time this season. The series would head back to Los Angeles tied 2–2. The Lakers came back with authority as they took Game 5 with Bryant, Gasol, and Odom scoring 20-plus points each. The Jazz looked to force a Game 7 but the Lakers closed out the series in Game 6 in Utah to end the series 4–2. Their victory on the road against the Jazz marked not only an impressive road win against a team with the best home record in the league, but also the second victory a road team had notched against a home team[20] in the entire 2007–2008 playoff Conference semifinals, as home teams had won at a 22–2 pace. The Lakers went on to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals. The two teams combined to win seven of the last nine NBA Championships. The Lakers were able to overcome a 20-point deficit in game 1 and win behind Kobe Bryant's 27 points, with 25 being scored in the second half. Game 2 was a cruise for the Lakers as they made a 9–0 run before halftime and built the lead to 30. For the third straight series the Lakers started off 2–0. This also marked Ariza playing for the first time since breaking a bone in his right foot in January.[21] The Spurs easily took game 3 in San Antonio with Manu Ginóbili carrying the Spurs after two terrible games in L.A. The Lakers barely escaped Game 4 with a narrow win after Brent Barry missed a last second three-pointer due to a ""missed foul call"" on Derek Fisher, even though Bryant, Gregg Popovich, and Phil Jackson all agreed that it was not a foul.  The NBA head office, however, admitted the next day that a foul should have been called, which would have given one of the league's top free throw shooters a chance to tie the game.  Heading home up 3–1 in the series, the Lakers trailed in the first quarter by 17 but were able to cut the lead to six by halftime. Again, Bryant stepped up by scoring 17 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter and the Lakers surged ahead to take a 100–92 victory behind their home crowd for a chance to win championship no. 15. They also improved to 4–0 against San Antonio in the Western Conference finals. The Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals again as the no. 1 seed. The last time this happened to the team was during 2000, where they beat the Indiana Pacers 4–2. The Lakers looked to renew their rivalry with the Boston Celtics as the two matched up for the 11th time in the NBA Finals. The Celtics own an 8–2 record all-time against the Lakers in the NBA Finals, but were defeated by Los Angeles the last two times they met in 1985 and 1987. Entering the finals, the Celtics and the Lakers held the record for most Finals appearances (Celtics 19, Lakers 28) including the 2008 Finals, and most championships (Celtics 16, Lakers 14). The Celtics went on to win the Finals 4–2 for their 17th NBA championship. *Total for entire season including previous team(s) The Lakers have been involved in the following transactions during the 2007–08 season.",Phil Jackson,0.695,1.0,True,True,True,False,1.0
Los Angeles Lakers,2008,2009,"The 2008–09 Los Angeles Lakers season was the franchise's 61st season, 60th in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and 49th in Los Angeles. Coming off an appearance in the 2008 NBA Finals, the Lakers won their division for the 31st time and appeared in the NBA Finals for the 30th time.[1] With 65 wins, they tied the 1986–87 team for the third most wins in franchise history, the most since 1999–2000, and improved on their 2007–08 record by eight wins.[2] The Lakers sold out all 41 home games for the season, led the NBA in money earned from overall ticket sales, and had the 5th highest increase in gate receipts from the previous season.[3] The Lakers had the third best team offensive rating in the NBA.[4] Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol were both selected for the 2009 NBA All-Star Game in Phoenix, with head coach Phil Jackson coaching the Western Conference, and with Bryant winning his third All-Star Game MVP award. Bryant finished second in league MVP voting, averaging 26.8 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.5 steals per game. In addition, Gasol averaged 18.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1 block per game. Bryant was named both First Team All-NBA and First Team All-Defense, while Gasol was both named to the All-NBA Third Team. Phil Jackson reached 1,000 career wins on December 25, 2008, against the Boston Celtics. With 1,423 games coached, he became the fastest coach in NBA history to reach 1,000 wins, surpassing former Lakers coach Pat Riley. In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Utah Jazz in five games in the First Round, then defeated the Houston Rockets in a hard-fought seven games in the Semifinals, and on May 29, the Lakers defeated the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals to advance to the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year and 30th time in franchise history, extending their NBA record for most Finals appearances.[5] On June 14, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic 4–1 in the best of seven series to become the 2009 NBA champions, winning their first championship in seven years, their tenth title in Los Angeles, and the 15th overall in franchise history. Kobe Bryant was awarded the 2009 NBA Finals MVP. Following the season, Trevor Ariza signed as a free agent with the Houston Rockets. On July 15, 2009, the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2009 ESPY Awards for Best Team and Best Coach/Manager for Phil Jackson.[6] Following the 2007–08 NBA season, the Lakers faced two key injuries in the offseason. Andrew Bynum, who missed the second half of the season and playoffs was rehabilitating and working on conditioning. Trevor Ariza, who also missed the second half of the season, but later returned in the playoffs also had to work back into shape. Both players played on opening day. During the 2007–08 season, Kobe Bryant suffered a tear in his right pinkie finger. At the time, Bryant decided to forgo surgery and play out the rest of the season and participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He eventually chose to not to have surgery and let the hand heal naturally.[11] The most notable departure was last year's backup power forward Ronny Turiaf to the Golden State Warriors. As a restricted free agent, the Lakers were allowed to match any offer that another team gave Turiaf. The Lakers chose not to match the 4 year $17 million offer the Warriors gave.[12][13] Ira Newble, who the Lakers picked up midway through the 2007–08 season,[14] was not re-signed and remained a free agent for the rest of the season. Coby Karl was also cut from the roster with Sun Yue replacing him.[15] Sasha Vujacic was the first member of the Lakers to sign a contract with the team in the offseason. Still, contract negotiations dragged on longer than usual because he wasn't signed to a tender offer from another team as a restricted free agent. Vujacic considered playing in Europe, but ultimately signed a 3-year contract worth $15 million with the Lakers.[16] Andrew Bynum, who is signed for the 2008–09 season, signed a 4-year contract extension for $57.4 million.[17] DJ Mbenga re-signed with the team for one year for approximately $850,000.[18] Josh Powell was also signed to a one-year contract to replace the departed Ronny Turiaf[19]
The Lakers 2007 NBA draft pick Sun Yue, spent the entire 07–08 season playing for the Beijing Olympians in the ABA. He also played for China in the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the offseason the Lakers signed him to a 2-year deal.[15] Joe Crawford, C.J. Giles, Brandon Heath, and Dwayne Mitchell signed to the Lakers roster during the offseason but were all released before the season began.[20][21][22] Due to the midseason trade for Pau Gasol in February 2008, the Lakers only had a second round draft pick in 2008.[23] With it they selected Joe Crawford from Kentucky. He signed with the Lakers on August 27, 2008,[24] but was waived October 22, during the 2008–09 pre-season.[20] On February 7, Vladimir Radmanović was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in return for Adam Morrison and Shannon Brown. The deal was made largely to save money to be able to resign players during the off-season, notably Lamar Odom and Trevor Ariza.[25] On February 18, backup center Chris Mihm was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for a conditional second round draft pick in 2013. The trade saves the Lakers approximately $2 million in salary and luxury tax money.[26] When the Lakers made it all the way to the 2008 NBA Finals without starter Andrew Bynum, they were seen as the favorites from the Western Conference to return there in 2009. The team's original starting lineup was:[27] C – Andrew Bynum
PF – Pau Gasol
SF – Vladimir Radmanović
SG – Kobe Bryant
PG – Derek Fisher Having Radmanović start at SF instead of Lamar Odom was seen as a way to space out the offense since two 7-footers, Bynum and Gasol, were in the starting lineup.[28] With Bynum starting and swingman Trevor Ariza healthy, the team started off the season with a 7–0 record. A week later they tied the record for best start in franchise history. They were unable to break the record the next game, losing to the Sacramento Kings on the road. After peaking at a 21–3 record the Lakers played 4 games in 5 days on the road. They finished the road trip with a sub-par 2–2 record and were facing a rematch of last year's finals against the Boston Celtics on Christmas Day. Under the national spotlight the two teams kept the game close well into the fourth quarter, where the Lakers finally pulled away in the last 2:48 of the game. Phil Jackson earned his 1,000th career win in the game. The Lakers went to win 10 of 11 games, before losing back to back against the San Antonio Spurs and the Orlando Magic. The losses revealed how injuries to role players Luke Walton and Jordan Farmar could affect the Lakers. Jackson eventually benched the under-performing Radmanović and was replaced by Walton in the starting lineup.[29] Walton was chosen as starter because of his good passing skills and Jackson wanted to emphasize ball movement in the offense. Andrew Bynum was also criticized for his poor play, including a one rebound performance against the Houston Rockets on January 13. Bynum responded by going five straight games with a double-double including a career best 42 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.[30] Around the same time Kobe Bryant also recorded two triple-doubles for the first and second time in his career since 2005. On January 31, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Bynum left the game with an injured right knee after he was hit by Bryant driving to the basket. An MRI scan revealed he had a tear of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee and was expected to miss 8–12 weeks.[31] To adjust to the injury Pau Gasol moved from power forward to center to replace Bynum and Lamar Odom was put into the starting lineup as power forward to replace Gasol. On February 7 the Lakers traded Vladimir Radmanović to the Charlotte Bobcats for Adam Morrison and Shannon Brown. Radmanović saw his role decrease drastically with the Lakers when he was taken out of the starting lineup, often coming in behind Walton and Trevor Ariza. In a road game against the New York Knicks on February 2, Bryant scored 61 points on 61% shooting in a 126–117 win. Bryant's scoring outburst set a record for the most points ever scored at the historic Madison Square Garden, breaking Bernard King's record he remained for nearly five years until Carmelo Anthony broke his own record at this arena scored 62 points in 2014.[32] Bryant's performance was also the highest single game point total of the 2008–2009 season in the NBA.[32] Aside from the team record, another result of the team's success was Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Phil Jackson being selected to play and coach in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. Bryant was named the All-Star MVP along with former teammate Shaquille O'Neal. After the All-Star break, the Lakers won 17 of 19 games. After playing 27 of their first 46 games at home (a league high) the Lakers were on the road for 22 of 31 games; which started with a six-game road trip and ended with a seven-game road trip. The Lakers won the first six games on the road, including wins against the top two teams in the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers (Cleveland's first of two home losses during the regular season). After the All-Star break, the Lakers won six straight games, but then went 2-5 including going 0–3 on the road. The Lakers redeemed themselves by winning two road games in two days; including a win against the Houston Rockets who were on a 12-game home winning streak and their Western rivals (and second seeded team in the West) the San Antonio Spurs. In March, after recommending Phil Jackson to, Luke Walton was moved to the bench and was replaced with Trevor Ariza. Jackson hoped he can spark the bench activity which dwindled throughout the year. The change caused a surge in Ariza's production and allowed Walton to play less minutes against opposing teams' starting players. The Lakers were dealing with giving up leads in games and receiving inconsistent production from the reserves.[33][34][35] After spending the entire season with the best record in the Western Conference the Lakers clinched the top record in the Western Conference on March 27. Since then they were in a race with the Cleveland Cavaliers to finish with the best record in the league and secure home court advantage throughout the playoffs.[36] With a loss to the Sixers on March 17, the Lakers fell to second place overall. They eventually conceded the best regular-season record to Cleveland and clinched the #2 record in the league in April. On April 9, Bynum returned to the Lakers after missing 31 games. His first game back he started and scored 16 points off of 7-11 shooting and grabbed 7 rebounds.[36] The Lakers went 65–17, and clinched the Pacific Division and home court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs. In the first round, the Lakers faced the eight-seeded Utah Jazz. The Lakers won Games 1 and 2 at the Staples, but lost Game 3 in Salt Lake City, following a game winner from Deron Williams. All three games saw the Lakers give up big leads, though they were able to still hold the series edge. After a 5-24 performance in Game 3, Kobe Bryant scored 38 points in Game 4 on 16 of 24 shooting in a road win. The Lakers won the series in Game 5 with a 107–96 win at home.[37] In the second round the Lakers faced the Houston Rockets. In Game 1, the Lakers fell behind in the first quarter and never got into a rhythm.[38] As a result, they lost their first home game of the postseason. The Lakers rebounded in Game 2 behind Bryant's 40 point performance and a double double by Gasol and tied the series up at 1 win each.[39] The game was very intense and physical as Derek Fisher of the Lakers and Ron Artest got ejected and technical fouls were assessed to Bryant, Artest, Luis Scola, Luke Walton and Lamar Odom.[39] The series moved to Houston for Game 3 which the Lakers won 108–94 to retake home court advantage in the series. The Lakers went on to lose Game 4 87–99, despite Rockets center Yao Ming missing the game (and rest of the series) with a broken foot.[40] In Game 5 the Lakers blew out the Rockets by 40 points, tying the Rockets worst loss in franchise history.[41] Game 6 in Houston was a decisive 95-80 Rockets win. The Rockets jumped out to a 17–1 lead to start the game and were up at half time by 16.[42] Game 6 was the most watched basketball game ever on ESPN.[43] The final game of the series was played in Los Angeles on May 17. The Lakers routed the Rockets and won the game 89–70. With 2:30 left in the game the Lakers were up 89-58 and Bryant sat out for most of the 4th quarter. Kobe Bryant scored 14 points his lowest number of playoff points. In each game of the series the team that led at the first quarter won the game.[44] In the third round the Lakers faced the Denver Nuggets. In Game 1, the Lakers fell behind in the first quarter by up to 13 points. In the second quarter the Lakers found their rhythm and took a 55–54 lead at halftime. In the fourth quarter the game was close and Kobe Bryant scored 18 of his 40 points in that quarter to lead the Lakers to a 105–103 to take a 1–0 series lead. In Game 2, the Lakers took a 41–27 lead in the second quarter. In the final minutes of the second quarter the Nuggets went on a 14–2 run to get themselves within 1. Ever since that the game was close. The Nuggets were able to get a win at Staples Center 106-103 which gave the Lakers their second home loss of the postseason. In Game 3, there was another close game which the winner was not decided until the Lakers pulled away at 12 seconds when Bryant made 2 free throws. The Lakers stole home court advantage back from the Nuggets with a 41-point performance from Kobe Bryant (13 of them in the 4th quarter). The Lakers were able to stop Denver's 16 home game winning streak by defeating the Nuggets 103–97 to take a 2–1 series lead. The Denver Nuggets would even the series by defeating the Lakers 120–101, thanks in part to 49 free throw attempts. The Lakers 120 points were the most the franchise has ever given up on the postseason, and they also allowed Denver to score 43 points in the 4th quarter. The Lakers defeated the Nuggets at Staples Center 103–94 in Game 5. Game 6 was a blowout in which the Lakers defeated the Nuggets 119–92 to advance to its franchise's 30th NBA Finals appearance. While the Lakers were making their NBA record 30th Finals appearance, the Magic were entering only their second in franchise history. The Lakers had home court advantage due to having the better regular season record. The Lakers earned a blowout win in Game 1, defeating the Magic by 25 points. Game 2 was a tighter contest, with Magic guard Courtney Lee missing a game winning lay-up off an inbounds lob at the end of regulation. Instead, the game went into overtime and the Lakers prevailed. The series switched to Orlando for games 3, 4, and 5. In Game 3 the Magic shot 75% in the first half and 62.5% in the game, both NBA Finals records, to win by 4 and bring the series to 2–1.[45] Game 4 was another close game. Derek Fisher hit two key 3-pointers, one with 4.6 seconds left in regulation to tie the game, and the other with 31.3 seconds to go in overtime.[46] The Lakers moved within one win of their 15th championship by beating the Orlando Magic 99–91 to open a 3–1 series lead.[46] The Lakers defeated the Magic in Game 5 to clinch their 15th NBA Championship with a 99–86 win, winning two consecutive games in Orlando.",Phil Jackson,0.793,1.0,True,True,True,True,1.0

Instead, the Lakers struggled to qualify for the playoffs after changing head coaches and implementing multiple offenses. However, a weak defense and multiple injuries were the team's biggest problems.[1] They exited the playoffs in the first round for the first time since 2007. Additionally, this was the first season since 2006-07 without longtime point guard Derek Fisher, who had helped the team win its last five championships. Widely regarded as a failed superteam mainly due to injuries, the Lakers started out the season as a top 2 favorite to win the championship (the other team being the defending champions Miami Heat who ended up repeating) and the Lakers were projected to win 58 games.

The regular season began on February 5, and was cut short to just 50 games instead of the regular 82-game schedule.[12][13][14][15][16] During the off-season, the Heat signed free agents Terry Porter,[17][18][19][20] Clarence Weatherspoon,[21][22][23] and later on signed Blue Edwards in February.[24][25] The team went on a 7-game winning streak after a 1–3 start, winning 18 of their first 23 games, despite Jamal Mashburn only playing just 24 games due to a knee injury,[26][27][28] and Voshon Lenard missing 38 games with a stress fracture in his left leg.[29][26][30] The Heat finished with a 33–17 win–loss record, which earned them the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference.[31] Alonzo Mourning averaged 20.1 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.9 blocks per game, and was named Defensive Player of the Year,[32][33][34] and finished in second place in Most Valuable Player voting behind Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz.[35][36][37][38] He was also named to the All-NBA First Team, and NBA All-Defensive First Team.

Brown provided with 11.4 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, and Dan Majerle, who became the team's starting shooting guard, contributed 7.0 points per game. Off the bench, Porter contributed 10.5 points per game, and Weatherspoon averaged 8.1 points and 5.0 rebounds per game.[39] In the playoffs, the Heat faced the New York Knicks for the third consecutive time.[40] The 8th-seeded Knicks defeated the Heat in the Eastern Conference First round, with Knicks guard Allan Houston hitting a buzzer-beater basket in the winner-take-all Game 5, which prevailed the Knicks over Miami, 78–77.[41][42][43][44] With this loss, the Heat became the second number one seed in league history to lose a playoffs series against a number eight seed. The Knicks would become the first #8 seed to reach the NBA Finals, but would lose in five games to the San Antonio Spurs.[45][46][47][48][49] This was also the Heat's final full season playing at the Miami Arena.[50] Following the season, Porter signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs,[51][52][53][54] while Terry Mills re-signed with his former team, the Detroit Pistons,[55][56][57] and Edwards, and long-time Heat forward Keith Askins were both released to free agency.[58]",Pat Riley,0.66,1.0,True,False,False,False,1.0

O'Neal was traded away from the Lakers following recurrence of bad blood with former teammate Kobe Bryant. Despite their numerous conflicts during their 8 years as teammates, the duo led the Lakers to 3-straight championship titles from 2000 to 2002. The team played solid basketball posting a 14-game winning streak between December and January winning 25 of their first 32 games, then winning twelve straight between February and March. At midseason, the team re-signed free agent All-Star center Alonzo Mourning,[3] and re-acquired former Heat guard Steve Smith from the expansion Charlotte Bobcats. The Heat finished in first place in both their division and conference with a 59–23 record, which was the franchise's best since 1996–97. Second-year star Dwyane Wade led the Heat in scoring averaging 24.1 points per game, while O'Neal finished second on the team in scoring with 22.9 points per game.

However, he did return for Game 2 against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[25][26][27] Ewing averaged 20.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game in 26 games.[28] Without their star center for most of the season, Allan Houston finished second on the team in scoring, averaging 18.4 points per game, while Larry Johnson averaged 15.5 points and 5.7 rebounds per game.[28] In addition, John Starks provided scoring off the bench, averaging 12.9 points per game,[28] and finished in fourth place in Sixth Man of the Year voting,[29] while Charles Oakley provided the team with 9.0 points and 9.2 rebounds per game,[28] and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team,[18] and Mills contributed 9.7 points and 5.1 rebounds per game off the bench.[28] The team also used Charlie Ward as its starting point guard, with Chris Childs coming off the bench.[30][31][28] Ward contributed 7.8 points, 5.7 assists and 1.8 steals per game, and Childs provided the Knicks with 6.3 points and 3.9 assists per game.[28] During the All-Star Weekend, Houston participated in the 2Ball competition, which replaced the Slam Dunk Contest this season, and Ward participated in the Three-Point Contest.[32][33][34][35] The 1998 NBA Playoffs matched the Knicks against the #2 seed Heat, who had eliminated the Knicks in the 1997 playoffs in a series that featured a brawl during Game 5.[36][37] The altercation led to the suspension of six players, including five Knicks.[38] In the 1998 series, after the Heat took a 2–1 series lead,[39][40][41] another brawl occurred in the closing seconds of Game 4, which the Knicks won at home, 90–85 to even the series at two games each. Johnson and Heat center Alonzo Mourning, both former teammates on the Charlotte Hornets, exchanged punches, and New York coach Jeff Van Gundy clung to one of Mourning's legs at one point in an attempt to separate the two.[42][43][44][45][46] Three players were suspended for Game 5: Johnson and Mourning were both suspended for two games, and Mills, who left the bench during the fight, was suspended for one game.[47][48] The Knicks won Game 5 at Miami, 98–81, to advance to the second round,[49][50][51][52] where they lost to the Pacers in five games.[53][54][55][56] Following the season, Oakley was traded to the Toronto Raptors after ten seasons in New York,[57][58][59][60] while Starks, Mills and Cummings were all traded to the Golden State Warriors,[61][62][63][64] who Starks had previously played for during the 1988–89 season.[65] Meanwhile, former All-Star forward Buck Williams retired after seventeen seasons in the NBA.[66][67][68] For the season, the Knicks changed their home uniforms, adding blue side panels to their jerseys and shorts,[69] while their alternate uniforms they wore on the road frequently for the previous two seasons became their primary road jerseys.[70] Both uniforms remained in use until 2012, although they were slightly redesigned in 2001, where the side panels were removed from the bottom of their shorts.[71][72]",Jeff Van Gundy,0.524,2.0,True,False,False,False,7.0
New York Knicks,1998,1999,"The 1998–99 NBA season was the Knicks’ 52nd season in the National Basketball Association.[1] On March 23, 1998, the owners of all 29 NBA teams voted 27–2 to reopen the league's collective bargaining agreement, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system, and a ceiling on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed to the owners' plan, and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After both sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners called for a lockout, which began on July 1, 1998, putting a hold on all team trades, free agent signings and training camp workouts, and cancelling many NBA regular season and preseason games.[2][3][4][5][6] Due to the lockout, the NBA All-Star Game, which was scheduled to be played in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 14, 1999, was also cancelled.[7][8][9][10][11] However, on January 6, 1999, NBA commissioner David Stern, and NBPA director Billy Hunter finally reached an agreement to end the lockout. The deal was approved by both the players and owners, and was signed on January 20, ending the lockout after 204 days. The regular season began on February 5, and was cut short to just 50 games per each team instead of the regular 82-game schedule.[12][13][14][15][16] The Knicks' head coach was Jeff Van Gundy, serving for his third full year. The team played its home games at Madison Square Garden in New York City. To give All-Star center Patrick Ewing more help offensively and defensively, the Knicks acquired controversial All-Star guard Latrell Sprewell from the Golden State Warriors,[17][18][19][20][21] acquired Marcus Camby from the Toronto Raptors,[22][23][24][25] and signed free agents Kurt Thomas,[26][27][28] and three-point specialist Dennis Scott during the off-season.[29][30][31] However, Scott was released by the team to free agency after 15 games, and later on signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves.[32][33][34] Because of the lockout shortened season, and injuries to Sprewell, who missed 13 games due to a stress fracture in his right heel,[35][36][37] and Ewing, who missed 12 games with a knee injury,[38][39][40] the Knicks had to build chemistry on the fly, and barely made the playoffs with a 27–23 record, fourth in the Atlantic Division. The Knicks had to win six of its remaining eight games just to qualify.[41][42] Ewing led the team with 17.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game, while Sprewell played a sixth man role, averaging 16.4 points per game off the bench,[43][44][45] and Allan Houston provided the team with 16.3 points per game. In addition, Larry Johnson contributed 12.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, while Thomas provided with 8.1 points and 5.7 rebounds per game, and Charlie Ward contributed 7.6 points, 5.4 assists and 2.1 steals per game. Off the bench, Camby averaged 7.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game, and Chris Childs contributed 6.8 points and 4.0 assists per game.[46] In the Eastern Conference First Round of the playoffs, the Knicks faced the Miami Heat for the third consecutive year.[47] The Knicks became the second 8th-seeded team in NBA history to defeat the #1 seed, eliminating the top-seeded Heat in five games (one of the five games on one of the biggest shots in Knicks' history by Houston).[48][49][50][51] The Knicks then took down the 4th-seeded Atlanta Hawks in a second round four-game sweep in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.[52][53][54][55] Camby, who had struggled through most of the regular season, emerged as one of the key players off a deep Knicks bench. Camby's 11 points and 13 rebounds in Game 2 of the Atlanta series proved to be his coming-out party,[56] and the Knicks became the first #8 seed to sweep a playoff series as the team advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals to meet a familiar foe, Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers.[57] However, the Knicks would lose Ewing after Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, which the Knicks lost to the Pacers on the road, 88–86; Ewing had been battling through an Achilles injury, but it was learned that the tendon (which he had played on in Game 2) was partially torn, and he would be forced to miss the rest of the playoffs.[58][59][60][61] The Knicks were rescued by Johnson in Game 3. Standing outside the three-point line with 11.9 seconds left, Johnson held the ball, and then began to dribble. He leaned into Pacers defender Antonio Davis before jumping up. The referee called the foul about a half-second before Johnson released the ball, but it was counted as a continuation shooting foul. The three-point basket and the ensuing free throw gave the Knicks a 92–91 victory.[62][63][64][65] The Knicks would then stamp their ticket to the NBA finals with a 90–82 home win in Game 6, despite losing Johnson to a knee injury in the first half. Led by Houston's 32-point performance and defense against Miller (3–18 shooting), the Knicks closed out the 2nd-seeded Pacers.[66][67][68][69] The Knicks' 27–23 record was the worst for a team to reach the Finals since the Houston Rockets did it with a 40–42 record in 1981.[70] They also became the first 8th seed to reach the NBA Finals, a feat that has since only been repeated once by the Miami Heat in the 2023 season. In the Finals, the Knicks were halted in five games against the San Antonio Spurs. Completely overmatched by the Spurs' height with Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the Knicks lost at home with a 78–77 loss in Game 5 despite Sprewell's 35 points.[71][72][73][74][75] For the series, Sprewell averaged 26.0 points per game, and Houston provided with 21.6 points per game. The Knicks defense did not allow any opponent to score more than 96 points against them in their 20 playoff games.[76] Following the season, Herb Williams retired.[77] The team's season roster has been featured in the basketball game series NBA 2K since the 19th installment NBA 2K18.",Jeff Van Gundy,0.54,4.0,True,True,True,False,8.0

At the age of 35, Daigneault was at the time the youngest active head coach in the NBA, after the Minnesota Timberwolves fired third-year head coach Ryan Saunders on February 21, 2021.[2] The 2020–21 season was the team's first time since 2014–15 missing the playoffs and their first losing season since 2008–09, the team's inaugural season in Oklahoma City. It was also the fourth time under Sam Presti's tenure that the team had missed the playoffs.

They would eventually swap Webber to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for the rights to University of Memphis guard Penny Hardaway and three future first-round picks.[4][5][6][7][8] With the addition of Hardaway, the Magic acquired a guard who could get second-year star Shaquille O'Neal the ball more often.

The Magic won the first game at home, 94–91.[35][36] Tensions rose when Anderson indicated that Jordan was no longer the same player when Anderson was quoted by the media saying, ""No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to. No. 23, he could just blow by you. He took off like a space shuttle. No. 45, he revs up, but he really doesn't take off."" The comment motivated Jordan to return to number 23 and the Bulls evened the series with a 104–94 road win in Game 2.[37][38][39][40][41] With the series tied at two games a piece, the Magic won Game 5 at home, 103–95.[42][43] The Magic would eliminate the Bulls in Game 6 as the Magic won, 108–102 to advance to the conference finals.[44][45][46][47] In the Eastern Conference finals, the Magic would beat Reggie Miller, and the 2nd-seeded and Central Division champion Indiana Pacers in a tough 7-game series that saw the home team win every game.[48][49][50][51] The Magic were off to their first ever NBA Finals appearance. In the Finals, the Magic faced off against the 6th-seeded and defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. Shaq would be up against Hakeem Olajuwon in a battle of All-Star Centers.

However, Grant went down with an elbow injury in Game 1, which the Magic lost on the road, 121–83, and he was out for the rest of the series.[40][41][42] The Magic suffered another painful blow when Anderson went down with a wrist injury in a 86–67 home loss in Game 3, and he was also out for the rest of the series.[43][44][45] The Bulls would be too strong as they swept the Magic in four straight games.[46][47][48][49] Thereby, the Magic became the first team to be eliminated from the playoffs in a sweep for three consecutive seasons since the 1950 Chicago Stags.

As the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Magic drew top seeded Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs. On August 26, with the Magic facing elimination, the fifth game of the series was postponed as a result of the Milwaukee Bucks boycott in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake.[4][5] This ultimately resulted in a brief suspension of the entire NBA playoffs. In the days following, games in several other leagues were postponed as players refused to play in solidarity in order to bring further awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement. When game five was eventually played, the Magic lost, ending their season.

Eric Snow became the team's starting point guard, and provided with 8.6 points, 6.3 assists and 2.1 steals per game, and Lynch averaged 8.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals per game.[33] Iverson also finished in fourth place in Most Valuable Player voting,[34] while Snow finished in second place in Most Improved Player voting,[35][36] and head coach Larry Brown finished in second place in Coach of the Year voting.[37] In the Eastern Conference First Round of the playoffs, and Iverson's first ever playoff appearance, the Sixers defeated the 3rd–seeded Orlando Magic in four games,[38][39][40][41] in which Iverson recorded a playoff career-high of ten steals in a 97–85 Game 3 home win over the Magic.[42][43][44] However, the Sixers were swept in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals by the Indiana Pacers in four straight games.[45][46][47][48] Following the season, Grant and second-year guard Anthony Parker were both traded to the Orlando Magic, who released Grant to free agency,[49][50][51] and Mahorn retired after playing in his second stint with the 76ers.",Larry Brown,0.56,3.0,True,False,False,False,6.0
Philadelphia 76ers,2000,2001,"The 2000–01 NBA season was the 76ers 52nd season in the National Basketball Association, and 38th season in Philadelphia.[1] All-Star guard Allen Iverson had his best season in 2001; he led the 76ers to win their first ten games, and started for the Eastern Conference at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game in Washington D.C., and won All-Star MVP honors.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The Sixers also posted a 56–26 record, which was the best in the Eastern Conference that season, and the team's first 50-win season since 1989–90.[8] It was also the 76ers' best regular season record since 1984–85.[9] Iverson averaged a then-career high of 31.1 points per game, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. He also won the NBA steals title at 2.5 per game, and contributed 4.6 assists per game.[10] Iverson was selected to the All-NBA First Team, and named NBA Most Valuable Player for his accomplishments, beating Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal by a wide margin.[11][12][13][14][15] In addition, head coach Larry Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year,[16] All-Star center Dikembe Mutombo, who was acquired from the Atlanta Hawks in a mid-season trade,[17][18][19][20][21] won his fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award,[22][23] while being named to the All-NBA Second Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team, and Aaron McKie won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award.[24][25][26] McKie averaged 11.6 points, 5.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game, while Tyrone Hill provided the team with 9.6 points and 9.0 rebounds per game, Eric Snow contributed 9.8 points, 7.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game, but only played just 50 games due to a stress fracture in his right ankle,[27] and George Lynch provided with 8.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.[10] The 76ers had the fifth best team defensive rating in the NBA.[28] However, this season was not without controversy. With the Sixers having a big lead in the Eastern Conference with a 36–14 record at the All-Star break,[29] Theo Ratliff sustained a wrist injury that sidelined him for the remainder of season after 50 games,[30][31][32][33]
thus only having Matt Geiger and second-year player Todd MacCulloch at center. Ratliff was also selected to play in the All-Star Game along with Iverson, but did not play because of his injury.[34][31][35][36] The Sixers then traded him along with Toni Kukoč, and Nazr Mohammed to Atlanta for Mutombo.[17][18][19][20][21] By trading Kukoc (who was not included in the original proposed deal, and who won three championships with Phil Jackson as his coach during his tenure with the Chicago Bulls), the Sixers had only one other player on the roster who had NBA Finals experience, Snow, who played a total of 24 minutes in 10 games in the 1996 NBA Playoffs as a reserve for the Seattle SuperSonics. At one point the team's record was 42–14, but finished 14–12 the rest of the way, including a five-game losing streak in March.[8] In the last game of the season (at home against the Chicago Bulls), Larry Brown rested his starters instead of trying to go for a win. Had the Sixers won this game, they would have had the league's second best record (behind the San Antonio Spurs), and home court advantage over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Finals. Both had the same record, but the Lakers' record for non-conference opponents was better than Philadelphia's. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers faced the 8th-seeded Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference First Round. Despite losing Game 1 at home, 79–78,[37][38] the Sixers won the next three games, thus the series,[39][40][41][42] before meeting the Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. The Raptors took a 2–1 series lead,[43][44] but the Sixers managed to win the series in seven games.[45][46][47][48] In the Eastern Conference finals, the Sixers trailed 2–1 to the Milwaukee Bucks,[49][50] but managed to win the series also in seven games,[51][52][53][54] to advance to the NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Iverson scored 48 points in Game 1, which the Sixers won on the road in overtime, 107–101.[55][56][57] However, the Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant-led Lakers would win the next four games and the title.[58][59][60][61][62] Following the season, Hill was traded along with second-year forward Jumaine Jones back to his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers,[63][64][65] and Lynch was dealt to the Charlotte Hornets.[66][67][68] The team's season roster has been featured in the video game series NBA 2K. However, Rodney Buford, Roshown McLeod, Kevin Ollie, Pepe Sánchez, Raja Bell, and Speedy Claxton have been excluded from past installations of the game due to issues in regards to the permission of using the players' likenesses in the games.[69] For the season, the 76ers slightly redesigned their uniforms, which remained in use until 2007.[70][71] This was the last time the 76ers won the Atlantic Division title, and clinched the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs until the 2020–21 COVID-19 pandemic-shortened season.",Larry Brown,0.683,1.0,True,True,True,False,1.0

The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed to the owners' plan, and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After both sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners called for a lockout, which began on July 1, 1998, putting a hold on all team trades, free agent signings and training camp workouts, and cancelling many NBA regular season and preseason games.[2][3][4][5][6] Due to the lockout, the NBA All-Star Game, which was scheduled to be played in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 14, 1999, was also cancelled.[7][8][9][10][11] However, on January 6, 1999, NBA commissioner David Stern, and NBPA director Billy Hunter finally reached an agreement to end the lockout. The deal was approved by both the players and owners, and was signed on January 20, ending the lockout after 204 days.

America West Arena was the home court venue for the Suns. The Suns were led by point guard Jason Kidd, who averaged 16.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 9.8 assists and 2.2 steals per game. Kidd again led the league in assists per game, while earning another All-NBA First Team selection and NBA All-Defensive First Team (after being selected to the Second Team the year previous).

After advancing to the playoffs the previous season, the Suns started off to a disappointing start under head coach Frank Johnson. With the team at 8–13, team management elected to turn to assistant coach Mike D'Antoni to take over for Johnson. Under D'Antoni, the Suns would lose 40 of their next 61 games and miss the playoffs, finishing sixth in the Pacific division with a 29–53 regular season record, the first time since the 1987–88 season the Suns recorded 50 losses or more. The Suns played their home games at America West Arena. Before the halfway mark of the season, the Suns sent starting point guard Stephon Marbury along with Penny Hardaway to the New York Knicks for Antonio McDyess, and a lack of offense was felt the rest of the season. Marbury, a future All-Star, was replaced with rookie SG Leandro Barbosa, who only averaged eight points per game.[2] The oft-injured Tom Gugliotta was released and signed as a free agent with the Utah Jazz.

By trading Marbury, the Suns were without a point guard to lead an improving young core of Stoudemire, Marion, Johnson and Barbosa, all 25 years of age or younger. By shedding the injury-riddled Hardaway and Gugliotta, as well as Marbury, the Suns ended the season with a need for a club leader and money at their disposal.

It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock. Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game. However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach.

A season-and-a-half experiment with Shaquille O'Neal ended in the summer before the season. With this subtraction and the retention of Jason Richardson, the Suns were primed for a return to the playoffs after a one-season absence.

They would return to the playoffs, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in six games in the First Round and sweeping the rivaled San Antonio Spurs in four games in the Semifinals. Returning to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in four seasons, the Suns met the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, but lost the series in six games to the defending and eventual NBA champions.

What marked this season in particular were the trades the Suns made. In the offseason, the Suns traded for point guard Isaiah Thomas for 2013 second round pick Alex Oriakhi. Thomas was later traded in an infamously massive multi-team trade that also resulted in the Dragić brothers, rookie guard Tyler Ennis, and center Miles Plumlee going to some different teams in exchange for guard Brandon Knight from the Milwaukee Bucks, Marcus Thornton from the Boston Celtics, Danny Granger from the Miami Heat, and three different future first round picks (all of which were later used in different trades in future seasons). Before then, the Suns tried to remain competitive with smaller trades like trading Anthony Tolliver to the Detroit Pistons for Tony Mitchell (who was eventually waived), trading a future Minnesota Timberwolves first round pick (that was ultimately conveyed into two second-round selections) to Boston for center Brandan Wright, and being involved in a three-way trade with the Celtics and Los Angeles Clippers that gave them Reggie Bullock for Shavlik Randolph.",Jeff Hornacek,0.476,3.0,False,False,False,False,10.0

It also became the final season where Suns games were broadcast through Bally Sports Arizona (previously Fox Sports Arizona & FSN Arizona), as Mat Ishbia announced they would move their services onto more channels in the state of Arizona for a more widespread view after their regular season concluded. While Bally Sports tried to fight back against Ishbia's move by claiming a breach of contract happened, Bally Sports ultimately declined matching Gray Television's offer for the Suns, which later caused a chain reaction that led to Bally Sports Arizona losing broadcasting rights to other professional sports teams in Arizona before being shut down for good on October 21, 2023.",Monty Williams,0.549,2.0,True,False,False,False,4.0

It was the first season since 1971–72 without Al McCoy broadcasting any games. He announced his retirement after the 2023 NBA playoffs.[3] It also was the first season the Suns moved their broadcasting services from Bally Sports Arizona (previously named FSN Arizona and Fox Sports Arizona) back in 2003 to local broadcast stations in Arizona owned by Gray Television, branded as Arizona's Family Sports (with it also being included to Albuquerue, New Mexico viewers via FuboTV), alongside an over-the-top subscription service called ""Suns Live"" that was created by Kiswe.[4] During their first season under this change, the Suns would see a 69% increase in viewership by comparison to the previous season under Bally Sports Arizona.[5] This was the first season since 2018–19 without head coach Monty Williams after a second straight disappointing second-round exit. He was fired on May 13, 2023, despite having the team's first winning record as head coach since Jeff Hornacek, the first overall winning record and first coach to make the playoffs since Alvin Gentry, their first NBA Coach of the Year Award winner since Mike D'Antoni, and their first head coach since Paul Westphal (and third overall alongside John MacLeod) to reach the NBA Finals, with one season left on his original deal.[6] On June 6, the Suns hired Frank Vogel (a championship-winning head coach in the 2020 NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers[7]) over finalists Doc Rivers (who won the NBA Finals in 2008 with the Boston Celtics) and associate coach Kevin Young (who kept his job with a pay raise in mind),[8] with his new coaching staff made official on June 21.[9] On June 24, the Suns traded with the Washington Wizards to acquire 3-time All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal (alongside Jordan Goodwin and Isaiah Todd) in exchange for 12-time All-Star point guard Chris Paul, shooting guard Landry Shamet, six second-rounders, four first-round pick swaps (with at least one of them not conveying properly), and cash,[10][11] though the deal was later considered a part of a three-way deal with the Indiana Pacers.[12] This became the team's second trade for a star player in four months after trading for 13-time NBA All-Star and 2-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant during the previous season in February. During the month of July, the Suns made three more trades to gain more immediate draft capital on their end. On September 27, before training camp, the Suns traded center Deandre Ayton and rookie Toumani Camara to the Portland Trail Blazers in a three-way deal that sent 7-time All-Star Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Milwaukee shooting guard Grayson Allen, Portland center Jusuf Nurkić, and Portland guards Nassir Little and Keon Johnson (the last of whom was waived before the start of the regular season).[13] The Suns then made a three-team trade at the February 8, 2024 trade deadline with the Brooklyn Nets and Memphis Grizzlies to acquire Nets forward Royce O'Neale and Grizzlies forward David Roddy alongside a 2026 first-round pick swap with Memphis in exchange for mostly free agent acquisitions from earlier in the season in Keita Bates-Diop, Jordan Goodwin, Yuta Watanabe, Chimezie Metu, and three of the Suns' four remaining second-round picks they had at the time, and also signed veteran free agents Thaddeus Young and Isaiah Thomas (the latter of whom had played with the Suns during the 2014–15 season) in a final attempt to bolster up their roster for the season. Throughout this season, the Suns dealt with constant challenges that had them performing below expectations early on, such as the delayed debut of their Big Three of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Bradley Beal together until December 13, 2023 (with them not even seeing consistent playing time together until the end of 2023 and the start of 2024) alongside injuries and poor fourth quarter production by comparison to the rest of their quarters of play that would cost them some games, especially earlier in the season. Despite these consistent issues, including starting the season out with a 4–6 record and ending 2023 at 17–15, the Suns would still manage to obtain their fourth straight winning season in a row following a 131–106 blowout win over the San Antonio Spurs on March 23, 2024. They would then match last season's win total with a 122–101 blowout win over the Cleveland Cavaliers at home on April 3 and surpass it two days later with a 97–87 win over the then #1 Western Conference team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. After a dramatic April that went down to the wire at times, the Suns secured the sixth playoff spot in the Western Conference, avoiding the play-in tournament altogether due to a combination of a 125–106 blowout win over the Timberwolves and a 124–108 Los Angeles Lakers win over the New Orleans Pelicans, with the Suns holding the series victory over the Pelicans 2–1 this season. Despite sweeping Minnesota in the regular season, the Suns were swept in the first round by the Timberwolves (who fell to the #3 seed in part by the Suns' hands at the end of the regular season) in four games, losing each game by an average margin of 15 points. This not only was the first time since 2008 that the Suns were exited out of the first round, but it was also the first time they were swept in a playoff series in general since 1999.

In September 1981, while at the University of Kentucky, Sam Bowie was diagnosed with having a fractured shin bone in his left leg. This was previously misdiagnosed as a shin splint.[2] Bowie would not play for Kentucky until the 1983–84 season. Prior to the diagnosis, Bowie averaged 17.1 points per game and 9.1 rebounds per game in 1980–81. At that time there were serious discussions about Bowie entering the 1981 NBA Draft.

When Bowie returned from his injury in 1983, he would average 10.5 points per game and 9.2 rebounds per game.[2] The Blazers general manager Stu Inman had made it known that if Sam Bowie passed the Blazers physical examination, he would be drafted by the Blazers.[3]
The Blazers had given Bowie a seven-hour physical to ensure that his leg had recovered from the two-year layoff between 1981 and 1983.[4] The Blazers criteria in selecting Bowie over Jordan was that the Blazers backcourt already had Clyde Drexler and Jim Paxson.

They advanced to the semifinals where they faced the Cleveland Cavaliers once again, the team that had eliminated them in the past two NBA playoffs. Just like last season, the Raptors were swept in four games by the Cavaliers. It is also the third time in four seasons that the Raptors were swept in the playoffs, having been swept by the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 Playoffs. They have now lost 10 straight playoff games to the Cavaliers. This sweep marked the 1st time the top seeded conference team was swept in a playoff series since 2015, where the Atlanta Hawks were also swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference finals. The Raptors also became the first top-seeded conference team since the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2013 to have not advanced to the conference finals, and the first in NBA history to get swept in the Semifinals.

During the off-season, the Raptors acquired small forward Kawhi Leonard from the San Antonio Spurs after trading franchise star DeMar DeRozan. The season ended with the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance and first NBA championship, ending the City of Toronto's 26-year championship drought if not counting Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship or Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships. The Raptors were one of two teams to have an offense and defensive rating that both ranked in the top 5 of the NBA. This edition of the Raptors is considered one of the best teams of the 21st century.[citation needed] On May 11, 2018, the Raptors fired Dwane Casey after the team was swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers
for the second consecutive time in the postseason.[1] On June 14, the Raptors promoted assistant coach Nick Nurse as their head coach.[2] The Raptors played their home games at newly renamed Scotiabank Arena.[3] For the first time since 2008–09, DeMar DeRozan (who spent his first nine seasons in the NBA with the Raptors) did not play for the Raptors, as he was traded, along with Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Later, on February 7, 2019, at the trade deadline, the Memphis Grizzlies traded Marc Gasol to the Raptors for Jonas Valančiūnas, Delon Wright and C. J. Miles. The Raptors later signed Jeremy Lin. The Raptors finished the regular season with a 58–24 record, one less win than their franchise best the previous season, second best in the league for the second consecutive season, earning the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They also won their fifth Atlantic Division title in six years. In the playoffs, the Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic in five games in the first round. They edged the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games in the semifinals to make their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2016, with Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater over Joel Embiid, giving the Raptors a 92–90 victory in the series-clinching game 7. The series was a rematch of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where the Allen Iverson-led 76ers defeated the Vince Carter-led Raptors in seven games. The Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals 4–2, winning the last four games of the series after being down 0–2 to become the sixth team to overcome that deficit. They won the Finals against the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, also the first NBA Finals series that was played outside the United States. They beat the Warriors 4–2, becoming the first  non-US team to win the NBA title.[4] The Raptors were the first Atlantic Division team since the 2007–08 Boston Celtics and the first Eastern Conference team since the 2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers to win the championship.  Prior to the Raptors victory, the Atlantic Division had had the second longest title drought in the league. This was also Toronto's first major sports championship since the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series, excluding Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship and the Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships.[5][6]",Nick Nurse,0.707,1.0,True,True,True,True,2.0

The Raptors had the second best team defensive rating in the NBA.[1] The Raptors lost 2019 NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard in the offseason as he signed a 3-year, $103M max contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, becoming the first Finals MVP to leave the season they won a championship.[2][3] The Raptors showed they were still championship contenders with Leonard gone, and went 53–19 in a 72-game season, a winning percentage equal to 60 wins in a full season. They were led by Pascal Siakam being an All-NBA and All Star starter, Kyle Lowry earning his 6th All Star selection, Serge Ibaka and Fred VanVleet having their offensive best year of their careers, the impact of Marc Gasol and OG Anunoby on both ends, the success of undrafted rookie Terence Davis who was selected to the 2020 NBA All-Rookie Team,[4] and Nick Nurse winning the 2020 NBA Coach of the Year Award.[5] The Raptors finished the season with the second best record in the league only behind the Milwaukee Bucks  like the 2018–19 NBA season. On March 5, 2020, the Raptors became the second team to clinch a playoff spot by defeating the Golden State Warriors.[6] The season was suspended by the league officials following the games of March 11,[7] after it was reported that Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19.[8] The Raptors faced the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs where they swept the Nets in four games.[9] They would go on to lose to the Boston Celtics in seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals.[10] Raptors Franchise Icon Kyle Lowry made his 6th straight All Star appearance.[11] Pascal Siakam made his first All NBA Team as he was selected to the 2020 All NBA Second Team.[12] Siakam was selected as an All Star starter in his first NBA All Star Game in 2020.[13]",Nick Nurse,0.736,1.0,True,False,False,False,2.0

For the 2020–21 season, the Raptors played a shortened 72-game season, as the season start was delayed until December.  The Raptors needed a temporary home arena as a result of travel restrictions placed by the Canadian government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 20, the Raptors announced that they would be beginning the 2020–21 season at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, (the home of the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning); they also considered the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (home of the Nashville Predators), the KeyBank Center in Buffalo (home of the Buffalo Sabres), the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, the Prudential Center in Newark (home of the New Jersey Devils), or the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville (home of the Louisville Cardinals).[3][4] This would be the first season since 1995 (prior to the expansion of the Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies) not to have NBA regular-season games played in Canada following the Raptors' announcement on February 11, 2021, that they will finish the 2020–21 season in Tampa, as a result of further border restrictions. It was also the first time since 2007 an NBA team has been temporarily displaced from their home city since the New Orleans Hornets were relocated to Oklahoma City due to the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on stadiums in 2005. With a few exceptions, the Raptors played home games behind closed doors for the duration of the season. As with the Toronto Blue Jays (and unlike the Hornets) the Raptors did not change their geographical name on account of their temporary re-location. The Raptors struggled with injuries throughout the season. On May 10, the Raptors were eliminated from playoff contention, ending their seven-year playoff streak and suffered their worst record since the 2011–12 season.[5] This was the first season under Nurse where the Raptors missed the playoffs.

The season was the first season that six-time All-Star and longtime Raptor Kyle Lowry was not on the roster since the 2011–12 season, as he was traded in a sign-and-trade deal to the Miami Heat for Goran Dragić and Precious Achiuwa.[2] On September 10, 2021, the Canadian government granted approval for the team to play home games in Toronto for the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On January 17, 2024, the Raptors traded star player Pascal Siakam to the Indiana Pacers for Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora, Kira Lewis Jr. and 3 first-round picks.

After a loss to the New York Knicks and an Atlanta Hawks win over the Portland Trail Blazers on March 27, the Toronto Raptors were eliminated from playoff contention for the 2nd consecutive season. Near the end of the Raptors' season, Jontay Porter would be investigated by the NBA directly on betting irregulates involved between January and March 2024. The games in question specifically revolved around losses with the Raptors on January 26 against the Los Angeles Clippers and March 20 against the Sacramento Kings, both of which had Porter leaving early due to complaints of injury or illness coming about (with both games coincidentally having Toronto losing by at least 20 points, if not more than that), though at least 11 more games were also bet upon as well. After the Raptors' season officially ended, the NBA would ban Porter from the NBA and the NBA G League development league for life on April 17 (three days after the Toronto Raptors' season concluded) following their own conclusive evidence they picked up. Porter would become the first NBA player to be banned for life for gambling purposes since Jack Molinas back in 1954, as well as the first player to be banned for life without a way to return to the NBA since Richard Dumas in 1996. He would also later face federal charges in relation to his case while playing in Toronto alongside four other co-conspirators. He would also later face federal charges both in the United States and in Canada due to his case involving both nations and admit his guilt to said charges in relation to his case in the US while playing with the Raptors alongside the four other co-conspirators.[3][4]",Darko Rajaković,0.305,5.0,False,False,False,False,12.0
