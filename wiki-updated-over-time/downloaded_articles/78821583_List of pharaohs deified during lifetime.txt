In [[ancient Egypt]], it was standard for [[pharaohs]] to be worshiped posthumously as transfigured being among the royal ancestors. However, it was exceedingly rare for this [[deification]] to be done during the lifetime of the pharaoh.<ref name="l189">{{cite web | last=Bryson | first=Karen (Maggie) | title=&quot;Man, King, God?
