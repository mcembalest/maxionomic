[[Christians]] were persecuted in 250&nbsp;AD under the [[Roman emperor]] [[Decius]]. He had issued an edict ordering everyone in the [[Roman Empire|empire]] to perform a sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] and the well-being of the emperor. The sacrifices had to be performed in the presence of [[executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|a Roman magistrate]], and be confirmed by a signed and witnessed certificate from the magistrate. Although the text of the edict has been [[Lost literary work|lost]], many examples of the certificates have survived.

Decius' edict was intended to act as an empire-wide [[loyalty oath]] to the new emperor (who had come to power in 249&nbsp;AD), sanctified through the [[Roman religion]]. Christian [[monotheistic]] beliefs did not allow them to worship any other gods, so they were forced to choose between their religious beliefs and following the decree.

Decius became [[Roman emperor]] in 249 as a result of military victories. He made efforts to revive Rome's "golden age", adding the name of one of his most admired predecessors, [[Trajan]], to his own, revived the ancient office of [[Roman censor|censor]] and restored the [[Colosseum]].<ref name="Frend">{{cite book|title=The Rise of Christianity|author=W.

== Requirements of the edict ==
[[File:Libellus-Mich-Decian-250AD-sm.jpg|thumb|Libellus from the Decian persecution 250 AD certifying that the holder has sacrificed to the Roman gods]]
The edict ordered that everyone in the Empire, with the exception of Jews, must sacrifice and burn incense to the gods and to the well-being of the Emperor in the presence of a Roman magistrate, and get a written certificate, called a [[libellus]], that this had been done, signed by the magistrate and witnesses.<ref name="Moss">{{cite book|author=Candida Moss|title=[[The Myth of Persecution]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-06-210452-6|pages=145–151|author-link=Candida Moss}}</ref> Numerous examples of these libelli survive from Egypt, for instance:<ref name="Frend" /><blockquote>To the commission chosen to superintend the sacrifices. From Aurelia Ammonous, daughter of Mystus, of the Moeris quarter, priestess of the god [[Petesuchos|Petesouchos]], the great, the mighty, the immortal, and priestess of the gods in the Moeris quarter. I have sacrificed to the gods all my life, and now again, in accordance with the decree and in your presence, I have made sacrifice, and poured a libation, and partaken of the sacred victims. I request you to certify this below.</blockquote>

== Exemption of the Jews ==
[[Julius Caesar]] had formulated a policy of allowing Jews to follow their traditional religious practices, a policy which was followed, and extended, by [[Augustus]]. This gave Judaism the status of a ''[[religio licita]]'' (permitted religion) throughout the Empire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smallwood|first=E.Mary|title=The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian : A Study in Political Relations|year=2001|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-0-391-04155-4|page=539}}</ref>
Roman authorities respected tradition in religion and the Jews were following the beliefs and practices of their ancestors. It was well understood that Jews would not perform sacrifices to the Roman gods or burn incense before an image of the Emperor. In contrast, the Christians were a new phenomenon, and one that did not seem like a religion to Roman authorities at all; both the earliest extant Roman references to Christianity, [[Pliny the Younger]] and [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' about 116, refer to Christianity as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]'', excessive and non-traditional [[religiosity]] that was socially disruptive.<ref>[[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44]]</ref> Christians had abandoned the religion of their forefathers, and were seeking to convert others, which seemed dangerous to the Romans; refusal to sacrifice for the emperor's well-being appeared seditious.<ref name="Moss" />

== Effects of the edict on Christians ==
Christians were prohibited by their faith from worshipping the Roman gods or burning incense before an image of the Emperor. Refusal resulted in the deaths of some notable Christians, including [[Pope Fabian]], [[Babylas of Antioch]] and [[Alexander of Jerusalem]]. The numbers of people put to death for refusing to obtain a certificate is unknown. Large numbers of Christians performed the sacrifices as required, so much so that authorities at Carthage were overwhelmed by the numbers seeking a certificate and were forced to issue a notice requesting people to come back the next day.<ref name="Frend" /> Many other Christians also went into hiding, especially in Egypt, Africa and Anatolia, including [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionisius of Alexandria]] and [[Cyprian|Cyprianus of Carthage]].

== After the edict ==
The effects of the edict on Christian communities, many of which had until then lived peacefully and undisturbed, was traumatic. Many [[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsed]] in their faith, and their readmission into the Christian community was opposed by the [[schism]]atic [[Novatian]].<ref>Kirsch, Johann Peter, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09001b.htm Lapsi], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910, accessed 16 July 2019</ref> By 251, efforts to enforce the edict had died down, and although short-lived, the "Decian persecution" became in the [[collective memory]] of the church an episode of monstrous tyranny.<ref>{{cite book|title= Chronicle of the Roman Emperors: the reign-by-reign record of the rulers of Imperial Rome|author= Chris Scarre|publisher= Thames & Hudson|year= 1995|page= [https://archive.org/details/chronicleofroman00scar/page/170 170]|isbn= 0-500-05077-5|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/chronicleofroman00scar/page/170}}</ref>

Decius died in June 251, causing his edict to lapse; it had been in force for approximately eighteen months. Deliberate persecution of Christians within the empire [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Valerian|resumed in 257&nbsp;AD]] under emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] followed by a [[Little Peace of the Church|period of relative tolerance]] under [[Gallienus]] before intensifying again in 303&nbsp;AD during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]].
