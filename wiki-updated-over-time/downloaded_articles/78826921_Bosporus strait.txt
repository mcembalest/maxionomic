The Bosporus connects the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]] and forms one of the continental [[boundary between Asia and Europe|boundaries between Asia and Europe]]. It also divides Turkey by separating [[Anatolia|Asia minor]] from [[East Thrace|Thrace]]. It is the world's narrowest strait used for [[international waterway|international navigation]].

Most of the shores of the Bosporus Strait, except for the area to the north, are heavily settled, with the city of [[Istanbul]]'s [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of 17&nbsp;million inhabitants extending inland from both banks.

The Bosporus Strait and the [[Dardanelles]] Strait at the opposite end of the Sea of Marmara are together known as the [[Turkish Straits]].

Sections of the shore of the Bosporus in Istanbul have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and those sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.

== Name ==
The name of the strait comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Bósporos}}), which was folk-etymologised as {{lang|grc|βοὸς πόρος}}, i.e. "cattle strait" (like "Ox-ford"{{efn|There is a certain (Oxonian) tradition of equating the name "Oxford" with "Bosporus", see e.g. Wolstenholme Parr (1820), ''Memoir on the propriety of the word Oxford'', esp. p. 18.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSwrr71vA7IC&pg=PA18 |first=Wolstenholme |last=Parr |title=Memoir on the propriety of the word Oxford, as applied to a seminary of learning; read to the Instituto of Padoua, in the month of July last. |location=Liverpool |publisher=William Grapel |date=1820 |page=18 |oclc=47642720}}</ref>}}), from the genitive of {{lang|grc-Latn|boûs}} {{wikt-lang|grc|βοῦς}} 'ox, cattle' + {{lang|grc-Latn|poros}} {{wikt-lang|grc|πόρος}} 'passage', thus meaning 'cattle-passage', or 'cow passage'.<ref name="Bosporos">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2320416 |title={{lang|grc|Βόσπορος|nocat=y}} |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |date=1940 |encyclopedia=[[A Greek–English Lexicon]] |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |via=[[Perseus Digital Library]]}}</ref> This is a reference to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological story]] of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who was transformed into a cow and condemned to wander the Earth until she crossed the Bosporus, where she met the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]], who comforted her by telling her that she would be restored to human form by [[Zeus]] and become the ancestor of the greatest of all heroes, [[Heracles]] (Hercules).

[[Io (mythology)|Io]] supposedly went ashore near [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (present-day [[Üsküdar]]), which was named {{lang|grc-Latn|Bous}} 'the Cow'. The same site was also known as [[Damalis (town)|Damalis]] ({{lang|grc|Δάμαλις}}), as it was where the Athenian general [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] had erected a monument to his wife Damalis, which included a colossal statue of a cow (the name {{wikt-lang|grc|δαμάλις}} translating to 'heifer').<ref>{{cite book |first=Friedrich |last=Sickler |title=Handbuch der alten Geographie für Gymnasien und zum Selbstunterricht |location=Kassel |publisher=J.

The English spelling with ''-ph-'' (''Bosphor'') is not justified by the ancient Greek name, and dictionaries prefer the spelling with ''-p-''.{{efn|name=spelling}} However ''-ph-'' occurs as a variant in [[medieval Latin]] (as ''Bosphor'', and occasionally ''Bosphorus'' or ''Bospherus''), and in [[medieval Greek]] sometimes as {{lang|grc|Βόσφορος}},<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DBosporus |title=Bosporus |first1=Charlton T. |last1=Lewis |first2=Charles |last2=Short |encyclopedia=[[A Latin Dictionary]] |date=1879 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |via=[[Perseus Digital Library]]}}</ref> giving rise to the French {{lang|fr|Bosphore}}, the Spanish {{lang|es|Bósforo}}, the Italian {{lang|it|Bosforo}} and the Russian {{lang|ru|Босфор}}. The 12th-century Greek scholar [[John Tzetzes]] calls it {{lang|grc-Latn|Damaliten Bosporon}} (after ''Damalis''), but he also reports that in popular usage the strait was known as {{lang|grc-Latn|Prosphorion}} during his day,<ref>{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Müller |title=Geographi graeci minores |location=Paris |publisher=Didot |year=1861 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VxFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7 |page=7 |language=la |quote={{lang|la|Herodotus (4, 85) nominat Bosporum Calchedoniæ ({{lang|grc|τῆς Καλχηδονίς τὸν Βόσπορον}}); Strabo, os Byzantiacum (p. 125 {{lang|grc|στόμα Βυζαντιακόν}}, p. 318 {{lang|grc|στόμα τὸ κατὰ Βυζάντιον}}); Joannes Tzetzes (Chil. 1, 886) appellat Bosporum Damaliten ({{lang|grc|τὸν Δαμαλίτην Βόσπορον}}) sua ætate nuncupatum vulgo Prosphorium.}} }}</ref> the name of [[Prosphorion Harbour|the most ancient northern harbour]] of [[Constantinople]]. In English, the preferred spelling tends to be Bosphorus.

Historically, the Bosporus was also known as the "Strait of Constantinople", or the [[Thrace|Thracian]] Bosporus to distinguish it from the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]] in [[Crimea]]. These are expressed in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 4.83; as {{lang|la|Bosporus Thracius}}, {{lang|la|Bosporus Thraciae}}, and {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος Θρᾴκιος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Bósporos Thráikios}}), respectively. Other names used by Herodotus to refer to the strait include [[Chalcedon]]ian Bosporus ({{lang|la|Bosporus Chalcedoniae}}, {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος τῆς Χαλκηδονίης}} [{{lang|grc-Latn|Bosporos tes Khalkedonies}}], Herodotus 4.87), or [[Mysia]]n Bosporus ({{lang|la|Bosporus Mysius}}).<ref>{{cite book |first=Friedrich Heinrich Theodor |last=Bischoff |title=Verleichendes wörterbuch der alten, mittleren und neuen geographie |location=Gotha |publisher=Becker |year=1829 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_NvYRAAAAYAAJ |pages=195–196 |language=de }}</ref>

The term eventually came to be used as the common noun {{lang|el|βόσπορος}}, meaning "a strait", and was also formerly applied to the [[Hellespont]] in [[Classical Greek]] by [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]].

== Geography ==
As a maritime waterway, the Bosporus connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and thence to the Aegean and Mediterranean seas via the Dardanelles. It also connects various seas along the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Near East]], and [[Western Eurasia]]. Thus, the Bosporus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and to the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming from [[Russia]].

There is one very small island in the Bosporus just off Kuruçeşme. Now generally known as [[Galatasaray Islet|Galatasaray Island]] (''Galatasaray Adası),'' this was given to the Armenian architect [[Sarkis Balyan]] by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]] in 1880. The house he built on it was later demolished. The island became a walled garden and then a water sports centre, before it was given to the [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray Sports Club]], hence its name.{{sfn|Tonguç|Yale|2010|p=421}} However, in the 2010s it was completely overbuilt with nightclubs. The government had these torn down in 2017. It reopened to the public in the summer of 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=fanatik |title=Galatasaray Adası hizmete açıldı |url=https://www.fanatik.com.tr/galatasaray-adasi-hizmete-acildi-2293801 |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=Fanatik|date=27 July 2022 }}</ref>

=== Formation ===
{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}

The exact cause and date of the formation of the Bosporus remain a subject of debate among geologists. One recent hypothesis, dubbed the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]], which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]], postulates that the Bosporus was flooded around 5600 BCE (revised to 6800 BCE in 2003) when the rising waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Marmara broke through to the Black Sea, which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Many geologists,{{who|date=May 2018}} however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Aksu |first1=A.E. |last2=Hiscott |first2=R.N. |date=April 2022 |title=Persistent Holocene outflow from the Black Sea to the eastern Mediterranean Sea still contradicts the Noah's Flood Hypothesis: A review of 1997–2021 evidence and a regional paleoceanographic synthesis for the latest Pleistocene–Holocene |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.103960 |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=227 |pages=103960 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.103960 |bibcode=2022ESRv..22703960A |issn=0012-8252}}</ref>

=== Present morphology ===
The limits of the Bosporus are defined as the line connecting the lighthouses of [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north, and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south ("Fener" is Turkish for lighthouse). Between these limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width is {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]].

The depth of the Bosporus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest point is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]], at {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shallowest locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu at {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off Aşiyan Point at {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="d">{{cite web |title=Türk Boğazları ve Marmara Denizi'nin Coğrafi Konumu-İstanbul Boğazı |url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008023403/http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |archive-date=8 October 2011 |access-date=2010-09-18 |publisher=Directorate-General of Maritime Affairs of Turkey |language=tr}}</ref>

The southbound flow of water is 16 000 m<sup>3</sup>/s (fresh water at the surface) and the northbound flow is 11 000 m<sup>3</sup>/s (salt water near the bottom).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gregg |first1=Michael C. |first2=Emin |last2=Özsoy |date=2002-03-07 |title=Flow, water mass changes, and hydraulics in the Bosphorus |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=C3 |page=3016 |doi=10.1029/2000JC000485|bibcode=2002JGRC..107.3016G |doi-access=free }}</ref> Dan Parsons and researchers at the [[University of Leeds]] School of Earth and Environment describe a [[Black Sea undersea river]].

The [[Golden Horn]] is an [[estuary]] off the main strait that historically acted as a moat to protect Constantinople from attack, as well as providing sheltered anchorage for the imperial navies of various empires until the 19th century, after which it became a historic neighbourhood at the heart of Istanbul.

=== Newer explorations ===
Before the 20th century it was already known that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in a geographic example of "density flow". Then in August 2010, a continuous 'underwater channel' of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] composition was discovered flowing along the floor of the Bosporus, which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were on land.<ref name="leeds.ac.uk">{{cite press release |title=Leeds Researchers Study Undersea Rivers with a Yellow Submarine |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803145648/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2 August 2010 |access-date=22 June 2018}}</ref> The 2010 team of scientists, led by the [[University of Leeds]], used a robotic "yellow submarine" to observe detailed flows within this "undersea river", scientifically referred to as a [[submarine channel]],<ref name="leeds.ac.uk" /> for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents—underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits.<ref name="leeds.ac.uk" />

The team studied the detailed flow within these channels and its findings included that:

{{blockquote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|title=Robotic sub records flow of undersea river|work=Futurity|date=2 August 2010|access-date=24 July 2013|archive-date=25 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425163303/http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

The central tenet of the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]] is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosporus was overwhelmed by a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake by 50%, and drove people back from the shores for many months. This hypothesis was supported by the findings of undersea explorer [[Robert Ballard]], who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the [[flood]] to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. Driven out by the rapidly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, people spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of a major flood. As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.

The first images of these submarine channels showing them to be of great size,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Di Iorio |first1=Daniela |last2=Yüce |first2=Hüseyin |date=1999-02-15 |title=Observations of Mediterranean flow into the Black Sea |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=104 |issue=C2 |pages=3091–3108 |bibcode=1999JGR...104.3091D |doi=10.1029/1998JC900023|doi-access=free }}</ref> were obtained in 1999 during a [[NATO]] [[SACLANT ASW Research Centre|SACLANT Undersea Research]] project using jointly the NATO RV ''Alliance'', and the [[Turkish Navy]] survey ship ''Çubuklu''.

The project was led by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons at the [[University of Leeds]], in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], and the [[Dokuz Eylül University|Institute of Marine Sciences]]. The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].

=== Villages ===
The shores of the Bosporus were once lined with small fishing villages that had grown up since Byzantine times but really came into their own in the 19th century. Until the early 20th century most were only accessible by boat (known as caiques) along the Bosporus since there were no coast roads. Today the villages are no more than suburbs of Greater Istanbul but many retain the memory of their original village status in the suffix '-''köy (''village' to their names. e.g. [[Ortaköy]], [[Yeniköy, Sarıyer|Yeniköy]], [[Arnavutköy]], [[Çengelköy]] and Vaniköy. These villages often had distinct identities associated with agriculture: Arnavutköy, for example, was associated with strawberry-growing while Çengelköy was famous for its sweet cucumbers.

== Human history ==
As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and it remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]]. In 2022 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Bosporus' importance as a route by which grain reached the world was thrown into sharp profile.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-08-01 |title=Ukrainian grain to pass through Bosphorus on Tuesday under landmark deal |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-grain-bosphorus-idUSKBN2P71D7 |access-date=2022-10-04}}</ref>

The Bosporus is visible along the right-hand side of the map, wrapping vertically around the historic city.]]

The strategic importance of the Bosporus dates back millennia. In the 5th century BC the Greek city-state of [[Athens]], which depended on grain imports from the Black Sea ports of [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium|of Byzantium]].

In an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the Black Sea, the Persian King [[Darius I]] the Great ({{reign | 522 BC | 486 BC}}) crossed the Bosporus, then marched towards the [[River Danube]].

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great to found his new capital, [[Constantinople]], there in AD 330. This then became the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

=== Ottoman era (1453–1922) ===
[[File:Allum Bosphorus.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Bosphorus, with the Castles of Europe & Asia''. 19th-century engraving by [[Thomas Allom]].

On 29 May 1453, the then-emergent [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] the city of [[Constantinople]] following a lengthy campaign during which the Ottomans constructed fortifications on each side of the strait, the [[Anadoluhisarı]] (Anatolian Castle, 1393) and the [[Rumelihisarı]] (European Castle, 1451), in preparation for not only the primary battle but to assert long-term control over the Bosporus and surrounding waterways. The final 53-day campaign, which resulted in Ottoman victory, constituted an important turn in world history. Together with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the [[Conquest of Constantinople|1453 conquest of Constantinople]] is commonly noted as among [[Middle Ages#Terminology and periodisation|the events that brought an end to the Middle Ages]] and marked the transition to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].

The event also marked the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]—the final remnants of the [[Roman Empire]]—and the transfer of the control of the Bosporus into Ottoman hands. The Ottomans then made Constantinople their new capital, and the base from which they expanded their empire in the centuries that followed.

At its peak between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire was able to use the strategic importance of the Bosporus to wrest control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which they regarded as an "Ottoman lake", from which Russian warships were prohibited.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|1995 |pages=[https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.turkeycountrystu00metz_0/?sp=66&st=image 22–23]}}</ref>

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed access to the strait. Under the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]] of 8 July 1833, the Bosporus and [[Dardanelles]] straits were to be closed to the naval vessels of other powers on Russian demand.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|1995|pp=[https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.turkeycountrystu00metz_0/?sp=67&st=image 23, 25]}}</ref> By the terms of the [[London Straits Convention]], concluded on 13 July 1841 between the [[Great Powers]] of [[Europe]] ([[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Second French Republic|France]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]), the "ancient rule" of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was re-established by closing the Turkish Straits to all [[warship]]s, barring those of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]]'s allies during wartime. This benefited [[Royal Navy|British naval]] power at the expense of the Russians, as the latter then lacked direct access to the Mediterranean.<ref name = Rozakis>{{cite book | title = The Turkish Straits | first1=Christos L. |last1=Rozakis |first2=Petros N. |last2=Stagos | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 1987 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJc7HWhF-K8C&q=russia&pg=PA23 | pages = 24–25 | isbn = 90-247-3464-9 }}</ref>

==== Summer Embassies ====
During the 19th century many of the foreign powers represented in Constantinople maintained second embassies up the Bosporus and would relocate their staff there during the hot, humid summer months. Most of these summer embassies were on the European shore at [[Yeniköy, Sarıyer|Yeniköy]] (Austrian), [[Tarabya]] (German, English, French, Italian) and [[Büyükdere, Sarıyer|Büyükdere]] (Spanish, Russian). Some of the buildings still survive today although the British Summer Embassy burnt down in 1911 and the Italian Summer Embassy, a fine building by [[Raimondo D'Aronco|Raimondo d'Aronco]], survives in very dilapidated condition.{{sfn|Tonguç|Yale|2010|pp=455, 460, 463}}

=== Turkish republican era (1923–present) ===
Following the [[First World War]], the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarised the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. This was amended by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], which restored the straits to Turkey but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and remilitarised the straits area. The reversion was formalised under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of 20 July 1936. That convention - which is still in force - treats the straits as an international shipping lane except that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non–Black Sea states.

[[File:Istanbul panorama and skyline.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Modern (2012) view of the European side of Istanbul from the southern entrance to the Bosporus]]

Turkey was neutral in the [[Second World War]] until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German [[auxiliaries|auxiliary vessels]] were permitted to transit. In diplomatic conferences, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] representatives had expressed an [[Turkish Straits crisis|interest]] in obtaining naval bases on the straits. This, together with Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921), was a consideration in Turkey's decision to abandon [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality in foreign affairs]]. Turkey declared war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |title=The Turkish Factor in the Geopolitics of the Post-Soviet Space |first=Igor |last=Torbakov |work=E-Notes |publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute |date=2003-01-10 |access-date=2010-06-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731000411/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |archive-date=2010-07-31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertcutler.org/ch91dc.htm |title=[Russian and] Soviet Relations with Greece and Turkey: A Systems Perspective |first=Robert M. |last=Cutler |date=1999-03-28 |access-date=2010-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do;jsessionid=DC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |title=Against who and where are we going to stand? |first=Ali |last=Bulaç |date=2009-05-04 |work=[[Today's Zaman]] |access-date=2010-06-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504145149/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do%3Bjsessionid%3DDC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |archive-date=2009-05-04 }}</ref>

Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, thus affording the straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.

During the early 21st century, the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossiysk]], was exported by tankers primarily to the U.S. via the Bosporus and the Dardanelles straits.

=== Istanbul Canal ===
In 2011, Turkey proposed to build a {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Istanbul Canal|canal]] west of the Bosporus, suggesting that it would reduce the risk presented to the Bosporus by oil tankers and other cargo ships.<ref name="Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newcivilengineer.com/archive/turkey-to-build-bosphorus-bypass-28-04-2011/ |title=Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass |magazine=[[New Civil Engineer]] |date=20 April 2011 |access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="ing.dk">{{cite news |last=Marfeldt |first=Birgitte |url=http://ing.dk/artikel/startskud-gigantisk-kanal-gennem-tyrkiet-118702 |title=Startskud for gigantisk kanal gennem Tyrkiet |work=[[Ingeniøren]] |language=da |date=29 April 2011 |access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> The project proved highly controversial and, {{As of|2022|lc=y}}, work had not been started on building the canal even though a route for it had been established.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Route of Canal Istanbul {{!}} Kanal İstanbul |url=https://www.kanalistanbul.gov.tr/tr/hersey/route-of-canal-istanbul |access-date=2022-10-04 |website=kanalistanbul.gov.tr}}</ref>

== In mythology ==
The Bosphorus takes its name from the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological story]] of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who was transformed into a cow and, pursued by a gadfly, was condemned to wander the Earth until she reached the strait. There she met the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]], who comforted her by telling her that she would be restored to human form by [[Zeus]] and become the ancestor of the greatest of all heroes, [[Heracles]] (Hercules).

According to [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]], or Clashing Rocks, once guarded both sides of the Bosporus and destroyed any ship that attempted to pass through the strait by crushing them. Their destructive power was finally overcome by the Argonaut hero [[Jason]] who managed to pass between them unscathed, whereupon the rocks became fixed, opening Greek access to the Black Sea.

== Crossings ==

=== Maritime ===
The Bosporus is traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as by recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.

The strait also serves a significant amount of international commercial shipping traffic in the form of [[Cargo ship|freighters]] and [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]]. Between its northern limits at [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] and its southern ones at [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]], there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]] requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. Compounding these difficult changes in trajectory, the rear and forward sight lines at [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli]] and [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]] are also completely blocked prior to and during the course alteration, making it impossible for ships approaching from the opposite direction to see around the bends. The risks posed by this geography are further multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city. As such, all the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this vital sea lane.

In 2011, the Turkish Government started to discuss creating a man-made canal roughly {{convert|80|km|mi}} long that would run north–south through [[Silivri|the western edges of Istanbul Province]] as a second route from the Black Sea to the Marmara. It was suggested that this would reduce the risk from shipping to the Bosporus.<ref name="Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass" /><ref name="ing.dk" /> The controverislal [[Kanal İstanbul]] project continues to be debated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=İstanbul Canal project to open debate on Montreux Convention |date=2010-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430073318/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |archive-date=2011-04-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-debates-whether-international-treaty-is-obstacle-to-plan-to-bypass-the-bosporus/2011/04/29/AFcaFrCF_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211162128/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-debates-whether-international-treaty-is-obstacle-to-plan-to-bypass-the-bosporus/2011/04/29/AFcaFrCF_story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-12-11 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Turkey debates whether international treaty is obstacle to plan to bypass the Bosporus |date=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= Turkey's Ambitious Infrastructure Projects | url= https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/turkeys-ambitious-infrastructure-projects |work=Worldview | publisher=[[Stratfor]] | date= 16 May 2013| access-date=2013-05-16 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

In 2022 the dues levied by Turkey for freight ships increased 500% to US$4 per ton, the first change since 1983.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five Fold Increase of Transit Fees for Bosphorus & Dardanelles |url=https://e-ulgener.com/i/Sc_wcSIfvDShqSkPpDCVXAyecoiBLvGtTGlPs2r39tI |access-date=14 December 2022}}</ref>

The Bosporus is fairly deep and there is no definite limit on the depth and length of a ship, but ships over 150 metres long or 10 metres deep must pre-book their passage. Those over 300 metres long must follow a special clearance procedure. There is an air draft limit of 57 metres.<ref>[http://northmaritime.com/ports-info/turkish-straits-instanbul-region/24-bosphorus-istanbul-strait.html Bosphorus (Istanbul) Strait] (2014 North Maritime)</ref><ref>[https://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TUR_1994_Regulations.pdf Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region, entered into force on 1 July 1994] (United Nations)</ref>

=== Land bridges ===
Two [[suspension bridge]]s and a [[cable-stayed bridge]] cross the Bosporus. The first of these, the {{convert|1074|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long [[Bosphorus Bridge|15th July Martyrs Bridge]] was completed in 1973 when it was called the Bosporus Bridge.

== Strategic importance ==
[[File:Russian fleet in the Bosphorus Strait.jpg|thumb|Russian fleet under the command of Admiral [[Fyodor Ushakov]], sailing through the Bosporus]]
The Bosporus is the only way for [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] (south-western part) and [[Ukraine]] to reach the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and other seas. Thus sovereignty over the straits is an important issue for these countries, as well as [[Turkey]], the state the Bosporus actually flows through.

Turkey does not receive tolls from ships passing through the strait. Turkey's military has broad powers in accordance with the terms of the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Convention]]. As of 2021, the Bosporus Command is located on the shores of the Bosporus and the military ships connected to the Command are anchored in the Bosporus waters.

Located on a peninsula at the intersection of the Black Sea, the Bosporus and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul has historically been one of the most protected and hardest-to-conquer cities from Roman times to the Ottoman Empire. Divided by the Bosporus, it is one of very few intercontinental cities in the world.

== Sightseeing ==
{{See also|Yalı|Ferries in Istanbul|İDO}}

The Bosporus has 620 [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Yıldız Palace]], [[Çırağan Palace]], [[Feriye Palaces]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[Küçüksu Palace]], [[Ihlamur Palace]], [[Hatice Sultan Palace]] and [[Adile Sultan Palace]] also stand on or near its shores. Other buildings and landmarks on the Bosporus include the [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex|Kılıç]] Egyptian Consulate at [[Bebek, Beşiktaş|Bebek]], [[Bebek Mosque]], [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Robert College]], [[Rumelihisarı|Rumeli Castle]] (RumelihisarI), [[Perili Köşk|Borusan Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]], [[Sadberk Hanım Museum]], [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Üsküdar)|Üsküdar Mihrimah Sultan Mosque]],  [[Şemsi Pasha Mosque|Şemsipaşa Mosque]], [[Maiden's Tower]] (Kızkulesi), [[Beylerbeyi Mosque]], [[Anadoluhisarı|Anadolu Castle]] (Anadoluhisarı), [[Kuleli Military High School]], [[Adile Sultan Palace]],  [[Küçüksu Pavilion]], [[Khedive's Palace|Khedive's Villa]], [[Beykoz Mecidiye Pavilion]] and [[Yoros Castle]] (Anadaolu Kavağı).

[[File:2007 0919 Bosporus Rumelihisarı.jpg|thumb|[[Rumelihisarı]], one of the castles on the Bosporus, with two of the [[suspension bridge]]s which span the strait]]

Most of the [[ferries in Istanbul|public ferries]] that traverse the strait leave from [[Eminönü]] on the [[Constantinople|historic peninsula]] of Istanbul and travel as far as [[Yoros Castle#Anadolu Kavağı|Anadolu Kavağı]] near the [[Black Sea]]. On the way they call briefly at points on both the European and Asian shores. Private ferries, also leaving from Eminönü, travel only as far as one of the first two Bosporus bridges. Ferries from Eminönü also travel as far as Rumeli Kavaği, stopping only at points on the European shore, while other ferries from Üsküdar travel as far as Anadolu Kavağı, stopping only at points on the Asian shore. Frequent public ferries from Eminõnü, [[Karaköy]], [[Beşiktaş]], [[Kadıköy]] and [[Üsküdar|Usküdar]] offer short hops from one side of the Bosporus to the other throughout the day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Şehir Hatları A.Ş. ® |url=https://www.sehirhatlari.istanbul/en |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=www.sehirhatlari.istanbul}}</ref>

Catamaran [[İDO|sea buses]] offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosporus, but they stop at fewer [[port]]s and [[pier]]s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the sea buses also provide commuter services between the Bosporus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].

Tourist cruises are available from various points along the Bosporus, including [[Ortaköy]]. The prices vary considerably, and some feature music and dining.

[[File:36, Bosforo-ko yali gehiago ferrytik.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-era [[Yalı|waterfront houses]] (''yalıs'') on the Bosporus]]
The many ''[[yalı]]'' (waterside mansions) which were constructed along the shores of the Bosporus during the Ottoman period have long been synonymous with the strait. Those that still preserve their original form are among the most expensive real estate in Turkey although many have been lost to time, weather and 'accidental' fires. The oldest ''yalı'' on the European shore is the Şerifler Yalı at [[Emirgan]] which was built in the 18th century and belonged for a while to the Şerifs, the hereditary rulers of [[Mecca]]. It is still in good condition unlike the oldest ''yalı'' on the Asian side which is the Köprülü Amcazade Hüseyin Paşa Yalı at [[Anadoluhisarı|Anadolu Hisarı]], built in 1698. Only the central section of this ''yalı'' survives and it has been behind hoardings promising restoration since 2009.{{sfn|Tonguç|Yale|2010|pp=442, 544}}

Most of the ''yalıs'' originally sat right on the water's edge and came with private docks and ports where boats (caiques) could be stored. On the Anatolian shore some yalıs are still right beside the water but on the European shore most now stand back behind a coast road built on reclaimed land.{{fact|date=September 2023}}

The original ''yalıs'' usually had two main sections: the ''selamlık'' which was the public area and the part of the house used by the men, and the ''haremlik'' which was the private part of the house reserved for women and the family. These were the luxurious dwellings of the wealthy and some came with their own private [[Hammam|hamams]] (Turkish baths).{{fact|date=September 2023}}

=== Egyptian legacy ===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Egyptian royal family took a great liking to the Bosporus and often spent their summers on its shores. They left behind a legacy of fine buildings on or overlooking its shores, including the building at Bebek that now houses the Egyptian Consulate and the [[Khedive's Palace|Khedive's Villa]] (''Hıdiv Kasrı'') high on the hill above [[Çubuklu]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=From the Shores of the Nile to the Bosphorus: Traces of Kavalalı Mehmed Ali Pasha Dynasty in Istanbul |publisher=Istanbul Arıştırmaları Enstitüsü |year=2011 |isbn=9789759123956 |edition=1st |location=Istanbul |language=English, Turkish}}</ref>
