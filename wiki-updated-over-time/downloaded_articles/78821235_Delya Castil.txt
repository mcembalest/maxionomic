'''Matches Malone''' was originally a Gotham gang boss whom [[Batman]] attempted to recruit to help take down [[Ra's al Ghul]]. He was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, who began to impersonate the man to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=245–247}}</ref>

Post-''Crisis'', he was a small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to [[Gotham City]] early on in Batman's career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. After discovering that Matches had died as well, Batman adopted his identity as his own as nobody else knew of the death. Years later, Batman learned that Carver had committed suicide due to his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man.

After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Scarface]] for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] before dying. His last request was that Batman bury him next to his brother and avenge his death. Batman subsequently destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches. Talking with Nightwing, Batman observed that he would continue using Malone's identity as he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, the Dark Knight regarding his use of Malone's name as a chance to give Matches some absolution.

The "Matches Malone" identity indirectly caused the events of ''[[Batman: War Games]]'', when [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]], after being fired as Robin, attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow the latter to take control of the city's criminal organizations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince to take Stephanie back. Stephanie was unaware that the "agent" who was meant to take control of the meeting was Batman acting as Malone, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death.

In the ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' Rebirth series, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] uses the alias of "Trey Malone", son of Matches Malone, to infiltrate Terminal's Jokerz, but Terminal saw through Terry's disguise, due to recognizing him from high school.

Pamela first appears in ''Action Comics'' #[[What's so funny about Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001). While the origins of her powers are unclear in ''Action Comics'' #775, [[Manchester Black]] states that the rogue Men in Black (from the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) once picked up the dregs of society, turning them into weapons and selling them off to alien bidders. Black recruits Pam to be a member of the Elite. This group takes it upon themselves to "free the Earth of scum". They come into conflict with [[Superman]] during their first mission and Superman disables them following a showdown on Jupiter's moon, Io. The Elite are delivered into custody, but soon released by President [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #593–594</ref> During an assassination attempt on Luthor, Menagerie reveals to Superman that the Elite are acting against their wills. For her betrayal, Black induces a stroke in her, putting her in a vegetative state.<ref>''Action Comics'' #795</ref>

Sonja first appears in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August [[2004 in comics|2004]]). Upon Black's apparent death, his sister, [[Vera Black]], takes it upon herself to clear the family name and reassembles the Elite as a force for good. As Sister Superior she convinces Pamela's sister, Sonja, to assume control of the alien cache as the second Menagerie. Vera then approaches the [[Justice League|JLA]] with a proposition to form a sort of black ops JLA team: [[Justice League Elite]].<ref>''JLA'' #100</ref> Sonja's hatred of Manchester Black becomes a hatred of the Elite. Sonja sees this as her opportunity to kill Vera's dream, so she plays along and joins the team. In their first mission, Menagerie secretly coaxes [[Coldcast]] into killing the foreign terrorist dictator, Hi-Shan Bhat.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #1–3</ref> Menagerie lays low during the fallout and puts effort into her personal relationship with Coldcast. The two become lovers and are drawn together by their shared affection for Pamela. Then, while most of the Elite goes underground, Vera is finally fully overtaken by the disembodied Manchester Black.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #4–7</ref>

While Black threatens Earth with a [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] god, Menagerie goes missing and Coldcast is arrested by the JLA for Bhat's murder. Coldcast confesses to the murder and is taken to the Slab prison. There he is visited by the spirit of the recently departed [[Manitou Raven]], who frees him from Menagerie's control.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #10–11</ref> Coldcast is exonerated and the team tracks Sonja to Costa Rica, where she affirms that she acted against Vera to punish her for Manchester's role in the death of Menagerie's sister. She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts; Green Arrow observes that the process is basically [[heroin]] withdrawal multiplied by a billion plus one, and at first the beasts and the host can only be kept apart from each other by a transparent wall.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #12</ref>

While attempting to rob a masquerade ball, she defeats Supergirl, but George Lockwood kills her alien, de-powering Menagerie, who is arrested by President Philip Baker. Following her incarceration, Menagerie receives a letter from [[Manchester Black]]. In "What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?", Menagerie escapes from prison and joins Black, among others, in forming the Elite and attacking a military base in Wyoming in an attempt to reprogram a satellite weapon and use it on the White House, but they are foiled by Supergirl and her allies.

'''Dr. Michael Christian Amar''', a once respected [[surgeon]], succumbed to madness and started a killing spree to stop the voices inside his head. This spree went through [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central]] and [[Keystone City]] and caught the eye of police officers Fred Chyre and Joe Jackam. They later tracked Amar down with the help from Central City forensic scientist, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. Part of Amar's psychosis is the inability to stop himself from blurting out his crimes. Because of these outbursts, he is quickly convicted and sentenced to death. <ref>''The Flash: Iron Heights''</ref>

It is soon discovered that Amar's blood is so abnormal that lethal injection can not kill him. While incarcerated in Iron Heights prison, Amar cuts out his own tongue and sews his mouth shut so he will no longer be able to incriminate himself. Wearing a thin mask of his own design, Amar becomes known as Murmur. While in prison, Murmur creates a virus that kills the guards and prisoners and escapes during the riots it causes. He then joins [[Blacksmith (character)|Blacksmith]], who helps him with creating the virus, and her rogues. Afterwards, Murmur strikes out on his own.

Murmur is one of the villains being controlled by the [[Top (character)|Top]] during the Rogue War story arc.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1, Murmur is seen working in [[Gotham City]] with the [[Riddler]], the [[Body Doubles]] and the [[Fisherman (comics)|Fisherman]] in a murderous attack on Gotham police officers. He is seen in issue #7 as one member of the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], participating in an attack on Metropolis. A superhero army stops the Society. Murmur has also teamed up with another [[Batman]] villain - [[Hush (character)|Hush]] - in the ''[[Man-Bat]]'' miniseries,<ref>''Man-Bat'' #1-5 (June-October 2006)</ref> which takes place before the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event.

[[One Year Later|One year]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Murmur has made only one full appearance in the DC Universe. In writer [[Gail Simone]]'s ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'', he is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get-Out-of-Hell-Free card from the team. The only other mention of the villain post-One Year Later is a framed front page newspaper of the ''Central City Citizen'' detailing Murmur's arrest and incarceration by police. It is seen on a wall of the Allen household in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' #1.
