Discussing how he developed his sing-song style in an interview, Abanny said; "Growing up, I always had this high-pitched voice. I couldn't ever sing, you feel me, but I had a little high-pitched voice when I talked loud. I used to listen to [[Olamide|olamide baddo]]. I knew how to rap, and I used to write my verses. And if it don't sound right when I rap it, sing it. And it'd sound better. I used to let all my friends hear it, and they were like, 'I like that.' I just ran with it. If I can't rap it, I sing it.
