'''Mister Bones''' ('''Robert Todd''') is a character in the {{DC Universe}}, created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Dann Thomas]], and [[Todd McFarlane]], in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' #16 (July 1985).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=90}}</ref> A former low-level [[supervillain]] and member of [[Helix (DC Comics)|Helix]], he reformed and joined the Infinity Inc. team, then later the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]] (a government agency which regulates [[superhero]] activity) as a bureaucrat, eventually rising to the rank of Regional Director for the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. Thus, he now wears a suit and tie instead of a costume, and is also known as '''Director Bones'''.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Director Bones | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 101 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> A chain-smoker, he had a habit of speaking in rhyme in early appearances, but he no longer does so.

[[Keith David]] voices Mister Bones in ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Dr. Benjamin (also known as Amos) Love, a [[gynaecology|gynecologist]], injected six [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women with an experimental mutagenic drug. Each of the women gave birth to a metahuman child. Dr. Love kidnapped the infants and raised them himself, never allowing them to leave the house. The children learned all they knew from books, radio, and television.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #18. DC Comics.</ref> Later, the six young adults learned the true story of their origin from reading Love's diary and confronted him. They decided to execute him for what he did to them and Bones took Dr. Love out in the desert alone to kill him with his [[cyanide]] touch; the doctor begged for his life and Bones felt pity for him and let him go. Bones later showed the rest of his "family" the grave of Doctor Love.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #52. DC Comics.</ref> After the supposed death of Doctor Love and taking their cue from the [[superhero]]es they had watched on television, the six created costumes to go with the names Doctor Love had given them and called their group [[Helix (DC Comics)|Helix]] with them taking on names like [[Penny Dreadful (comics)|Penny Dreadful]], [[Tao Jones]], [[Kritter (comics)|Kritter]], Baby Boom, and Arak Wind-Walker.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Working with Helix===
The team kidnapped the [[Infinity, Inc.|Infinitor]] [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] in an attempt to extort money. Although they were defeated by Fury's teammates, [[Infinity, Inc.]], Helix managed to escape.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #16–18. DC Comics.</ref> Later, the second [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] ([[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez]]) learned that she was in fact a cousin of Helix's new member [[Carcharo]] and that they are both products of the same genetic experiments as Helix. The two teams battled to a stalemate and Mr. Bones was arrested while the others escaped. Later, Mr. Bones was freed from prison by Doctor Love.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #25–28. DC Comics.</ref>

Carcharo soon turned on the Helix and kidnapped Mr. Bones. In the ensuing struggle Carcharo is stabbed with a long piece of metal and in a last-ditch effort bit Bones's leg off, and then died from cyanide poisoning. To make sure Bones got medical care, Helix turned themselves in to the authorities.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #29. DC Comics.</ref> Mr. Bones received an artificial leg and Dr. Beth Chapel ([[Beth Chapel|Doctor Midnight]]) helped him recover from his injuries, and the two formed a friendly relationship.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #36. DC Comics.</ref>

===Working with Infinity, Inc.===
Since they were minors, an informal court hearing was held to determine the fate of the members of Helix. It was found that Mr. Bones had too much of a negative influence on them. Infinity, Inc. was given custody of Bones while the rest of the Helix would receive treatment.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #38. DC Comics.</ref>

For most of his time with Infinity, Inc. Mr. Bones was not a member of the team even though he took an active part in their adventures and became a hero in his own right, and was eventually accepted by most of the Infinitors.<ref name="dc-ency"/> During the wedding of [[Hector Hall|Hector]] and [[Fury (DC Comics)#Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor-Hall|Lyta Hall]], [[Harlequin (comics)#Marcie Cooper|Harlequin]] (Marcie Cooper) used deception to have Bones and [[Sylvester Pemberton|Skyman]] meet at [[Solomon Grundy (character)|Solomon Grundy]]'s room. She then deceived Solomon Grundy into grabbing Bones's arm and using him to kill Skyman with his cyanide touch.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #51–53 (1988). DC Comics.</ref>

Racked with guilt, Bones left Infinity, Inc. When Dr. Love gained control of Helix and ordered them to kill Bones, Helix instead turned on Love, killing him. Helix then left in disgust, telling Bones he was no longer one of them. The Infinitors, though, granted Bones full membership in the team, but Bones's role in Skyman's death would end up being instrumental in their disbanding soon afterward.

===Running the Department of Extranormal Operations===
At some point after [[Infinity, Inc.]] disbanded, Mr. Bones became Director of a local branch of the U.S. [[Department of Extranormal Operations]] (D.E.O.), and as a D.E.O., Director Bones has had numerous interactions with the operations of the superhuman community.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He has at times asked various DCU teams for their covert assistance. Notably, he has worked with the [[Justice Society of America]] a few times, to the point that [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] infiltrated the D.E.O. headquarters to tell Mr. Bones to stop harassing them. Bones was also wary of [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], his old fellow Infinitor, after his murder of [[Hank Hall|Extant]]. Mr. Bones became a supporting character in ''[[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]]''.

Mr. Bones and the operations of the D.E.O. are featured in the ''DC Files Secret Files and Origins'' Year 2000 special.

In a ''[[Final Crisis]]'' tie-in, Mr. Bones is seen as one of the fallen during a strike against [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Female Furies]] in [[Blüdhaven]], with [[Count Vertigo]] and [[Negative Woman]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4 (2008)</ref> He later survived the encounter as he is seen with Atom Smasher in a bar in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 2) #27 discussing the aforementioned incident and the latter's position on the team. When Rothstein leaves with other Society members, Bones is seen on the telephone calling the [[Global Peace Agency]].

===The New 52===
In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. Mr. Bones is shown to be acting as the D.E.O.'s director and tasks agent [[Chase (comics)|Cameron Chase]] with capturing [[Batwoman]].<ref>''Batwoman'' #1 (September 2011).

Bones' mother's exposure to mutagenic drugs during pregnancy gave him three superhuman powers, two of which are extremely inconvenient to his daily life: superhuman strength; transparent skin, flesh, and organs that give him a skeleton-like appearance; and toxic, cyanide-like sweat.
