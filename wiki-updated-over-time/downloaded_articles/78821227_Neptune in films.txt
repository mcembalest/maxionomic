[[Neptune]] has appeared in fiction since shortly after its 1846 discovery, albeit infrequently. It initially made appearances indirectly—e.g. through its inhabitants—rather than as a [[Setting (narrative)|setting]]. The earliest stories set on Neptune itself portrayed it as a [[rocky planet]] rather than as having [[Neptune#Physical characteristics|its actual gaseous composition]]; later works rectified this error. [[Extraterrestrial life]] on Neptune is uncommon in fiction, though the exceptions have ranged from humanoids to gaseous lifeforms. Neptune's largest moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] has also appeared in fiction, especially in the late 20th century onwards.

=== Early depictions ===
The first time Neptune was mentioned in a work of fiction—then called "Leverrier's planet" after astronomer [[Urbain Le Verrier]] whose orbital calculations led to [[Discovery of Neptune|the planet's discovery]]—was in the 1848 novel ''[[The Triumphs of Woman]]'' by [[Charles Rowcroft]] where an inhabitant of the planet visits Earth.<ref name="StablefordNeptune">{{Cite book |last=Stableford |first=Brian |title=[[Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia]] |date=2006 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-97460-8 |pages=328 |language=en |chapter=Neptune |author-link=Brian Stableford |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&pg=PA328}}</ref> Neptune was usually omitted in the subgenre of works visiting multiple locations in the [[Solar System]] that appeared in this time, though it did make some indirect appearances in works not otherwise set there.<ref name="StablefordNeptune" /> [[Supernatural]] communication with its inhabitants appears in [[Marie Corelli]]'s 1892<!--Stableford gives the year as 1982, an apparent typo.--> novel ''[[The Soul of Lilith]]''.<ref name="StablefordNeptune" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Bleiler |first=Everett Franklin |title=[[Science-Fiction: The Early Years|Science-fiction, the Early Years: A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Magazines in 1930: with Author, Title, and Motif Indexes]] |date=1990 |publisher=Kent State University Press |others=With the assistance of [[Richard Bleiler|Richard J.

Early works incorrectly depicted Neptune as a [[rocky planet|solid planet]], and several stories thus include human expeditions to its surface.<ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /> The earliest story where Neptune itself directly appears as a setting is the 1929 short story "[[A Baby on Neptune]]" by [[Clare Winger Harris]] and [[Miles J.

The most significant appearance of Neptune in fiction in this era is in the 1930 novel ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]],<ref name="SFEOuterPlanets" /> which outlines the [[future history]] of humanity through several billions of years and various sequential species from the First Men to the Eighteenth.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2022 |title=Stapledon, Olaf |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |url=https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/stapledon_olaf |access-date=2023-04-30 |edition=4th |author1-last=Ashley |author1-first=Mike |author1-link=Mike Ashley (writer) |author2-last=Clute |author2-first=John |author2-link=John Clute |editor1-last=Clute |editor1-first=John |editor1-link=John Clute |editor2-last=Langford |editor2-first=David |editor2-link=David Langford |editor3-last=Sleight |editor3-first=Graham |editor3-link=Graham Sleight}}</ref> In the story, Neptune becomes humanity's refuge in the [[Far future in fiction|far future]] when the Sun expands.<ref name="SFEOuterPlanets" /><ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /><ref name="WandererAmHimmelNeptune" /><ref name="GreenwoodOuterPlanets">{{Cite book |last=McKinney |first=Richard L. |title=[[The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders]] |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32951-7 |editor-last=Westfahl |editor-first=Gary |editor-link=Gary Westfahl |pages=449–450 |language=en |chapter=Jupiter and the Outer Planets |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/greenwoodencyclo0000unse_k2b9/page/449/mode/2up}}</ref> This plot point would later reappear in the 1934 short story "[[Twilight (Campbell short story)|Twilight]]" by [[John W.

Once more became known about Neptune through advances in [[planetary science]], fiction writers began portraying it more accurately as a [[gaseous planet]].<ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /> Thus [[Alexei Panshin]]'s 1969 short story "[[One Sunday in Neptune]]" depicts a voyage into Neptune's atmosphere<ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /> and [[Alex Irvine]]'s 2003 short story "[[Shepherded by Galatea]]" features [[resource extraction]] in the atmosphere.<ref name="StablefordNeptune" /> In the 1969 novel ''[[Macroscope (novel)|Macroscope]]'' by [[Piers Anthony]], Neptune is converted to a [[world ship]],<ref name="SFEOuterPlanets" /> and in the 1997 film ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' the titular spacecraft is adrift in Neptunian orbit.<ref name="WandererAmHimmelNeptune" /> The planet also appears in [[Jack Williamson]]'s 1985 short story "[[At the Human Limit]]", [[Gregory Feeley]]'s 1986 short story "[[Neptune's Reach]]", the adventures of [[comic book]] [[superhero]] ''[[Superman]]'', the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and the [[video game]] ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]''.<ref name="WandererAmHimmelNeptune" /><ref name="GreenwoodOuterPlanets" /><ref name="StablefordNeptune" />

== Triton ==
Neptune's largest moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] was discovered less than a month after the planet.<ref name="StablefordNeptune" /> A few works in the 1930s depicted humans going to Triton, looking for minerals in [[Roman Frederick Starzl]]'s 1932 short story "[[The Power Satellite]]" and a permanent home in [[John R. Pierce]]'s 1930 short story "[[The Relics from the Earth]]".<ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /> In the 1950s, the moon appeared in [[Margaret St. Clair]]'s 1950 short story "[[The Pillows (short story)|The Pillows]]" and [[Alfred Bester]]'s 1956 novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]''—albeit called "Lassell" in the latter, after its discoverer [[William Lassell]].<ref name="SFEOuterPlanets" /><ref name="WestfahlOuterPlanets" /> In the late 20th century it started receiving more attention from science fiction writers than Neptune itself.<ref name="StablefordNeptune" /> The main such work is [[Samuel R.
