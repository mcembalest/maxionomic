==Critical reception==
In his review of the album, Carl Wilson of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' gave the song a mixed review, saying that "The "beware who enter" sign is hung by the opener, "Beautiful Drug," which doesn't just flirt with top 40 EDM but checks it into a cheap motel for a quickie. The affair is brisk and forgettable, and soon gives way to more comfy MOR and gospel-rock cuts, but notice has been served."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6546230/zac-brown-band-jekyll-and-hyde-album-review|title=Album Review: Zac Brown Band Captures Its Onstage Madness With 'Jekyll + Hyde'|last=Wilson|first=Carl|date=28 April 2015|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref> A review from ''[[Taste of Country]]'' was favorable, saying that "it's the most left-of-center single Zac Brown Band have ever released, which translates to their biggest risk. One gets a sense that this band is pretty comfortable at the edges of the format. It's the secret all but the most casual fan was aware of already anyway" and "Not all will [love it], as ZBB employ more effects than ever. But the song's relentless energy will convert most quickly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/zac-brown-band-beautiful-drug/|title=Zac Brown Band, 'Beautiful Drug' [Listen]|date=September 8, 2015|work=[[Taste of Country]]|accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref>

In February 2024, vocalist [[Zac Brown]] announced the release of DJ [[Avicii]] remix of the song "Beautiful Drug."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Heffler |first=Jason |date=2024-02-16 |title=A Never-Before-Heard Remix by Avicii Has Been Released by Zac Brown Band: Listen |url=https://edm.com/music-releases/avicii-never-before-heard-remix-released-zac-brown-band |access-date=2025-01-06 |website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists |language=en}}</ref>

=== Background ===
Zac Brown and Avicii had previously collaborated on the track "[[Broken Arrows (song)|Broken Arrows]]" for Avicii ''[[Stories (Avicii album)|Stories]]'' album. In return for this collaboration, Avicii promised to remix one of Zac Brown's songs, ultimately choosing "Beautiful Drug." Zac revealed that the song "had been locked away in the vault for a long time." Avicii worked on the remix between 2016 and 2017, but it was never released by the DJ himself. Instead, it was posthumously made available by Zac Brown.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-16 |title=Unreleased Avicii remix, 'Beautiful Drug', shared for the first time: Listen |url=https://djmag.com/news/unreleased-avicii-remix-beautiful-drug-shared-first-time-listen |access-date=2025-01-06 |website=DJ Mag |language=en}}</ref>
