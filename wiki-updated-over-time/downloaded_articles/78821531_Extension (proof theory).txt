{{Short description|Concept in mathematics}}
In [[mathematical logic]], a '''conservative extension''' is a [[Theory (mathematical logic)#Subtheories and extensions|supertheory]] of a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] which is often convenient for proving [[theorem]]s, but proves no new theorems about the language of the original theory. Similarly, a '''non-conservative extension''' is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original.

More formally stated, a theory <math>T_2</math> is a ([[Proof theory|proof theoretic]]) conservative extension of a theory <math>T_1</math> if every theorem of <math>T_1</math> is a theorem of <math>T_2</math>, and any theorem of <math>T_2</math> in the language of <math>T_1</math> is already a theorem of <math>T_1</math>.

More generally, if <math>\Gamma</math> is a set of [[Well-formed formula|formulas]] in the common language of <math>T_1</math> and <math>T_2</math>, then <math>T_2</math> is <math>\Gamma</math>'''-conservative''' over <math>T_1</math> if every formula from <math>\Gamma</math> provable in <math>T_2</math> is also provable in <math>T_1</math>.

Note that a conservative extension of a [[consistent]] theory is consistent. If it were not, then by the [[principle of explosion]], every formula in the language of <math>T_2</math> would be a theorem of <math>T_2</math>, so every formula in the language of <math>T_1</math> would be a theorem of <math>T_1</math>, so <math>T_1</math> would not be consistent. Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a [[methodology]] for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory, <math>T_0</math>, that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions <math>T_1</math>, <math>T_2</math>, ... of it.

Recently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of [[ontology modularization|module]] for [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}: if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory.

An extension which is not conservative may be called a '''proper extension'''.

==Model-theoretic conservative extension==
{{see also|Extension (model theory)}}
With [[Model theory|model-theoretic]] means, a stronger notion is obtained: an extension <math>T_2</math> of a theory <math>T_1</math> is '''model-theoretically conservative''' if <math>T_1 \subseteq T_2</math> and every model of <math>T_1</math> can be expanded to a model of <math>T_2</math>. Each model-theoretic conservative extension also is a (proof-theoretic) conservative extension in the above sense.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Hodges | first1=Wilfrid | author1-link=Wilfrid Hodges | title=A shorter model theory | publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]| location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-58713-6 | year=1997 | postscript=<!--None--> | page=58 exercise 8}}</ref> The model theoretic notion has the advantage over the proof theoretic one that it does not depend so much on the language at hand; on the other hand, it is usually harder to establish model theoretic conservativity.
