Parliamentary elections were held in [[Andorra]] on 14 December 1971 to elect half of the members of the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council]]. In constituencies where not all seats were filled in the first round, a second round was held on 21 December.

The elections were the first after women were granted the right to vote in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.ipu.org/parliament/AD/AD-LC01/data-on-women/|title=Andorra|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
Each parish had four seats in the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council]]. The seats were elected on a staggered basis, with two members elected from each parish every two years. In [[Andorra la Vella]] parish two members represented the town of Andorra la Vella and two represented [[Les Escaldes]], with one member elected from each every two years.

All candidates had to run on lists of candidates, although voters could split their votes between candidates on different lists. Any candidate receiving a majority of the vote was elected in the first round. If there were remaining seats to fill, a second round was held, in which candidates had to receive a majority of the vote to be elected. If there were still remaining seats to fill, a third round would be held in which the candidate(s) with the most votes would be elected.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p156 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>
